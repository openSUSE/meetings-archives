14:47:58 <shlok007> Since the last stand up I worked on organization admins ( https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1538 ) fixing the breaking changes across the application, which is merged now. To-do: figure out a way to safely remove ability for signed in user and not signed in user from admin_ability.rb ( https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1557 ) and work on UI to add/remove organization admins.
