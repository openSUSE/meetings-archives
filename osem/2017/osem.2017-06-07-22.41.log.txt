22:41:41 <shlok007> Completed PR to introduce organizations. Stuck on a couple of failing tests. Gone through CanCanCan and Rolify and worked with introducing organization admins. Todo: mockups about how to assign organization admins to organizations. I'll complete the work with organization admins and make a separate PR with it.
