02:09:47 <shlok007> Worked on https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/issues/1509 and https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/issues/1512 and added appropriate tests for the same. Unfortunately, this took more time than anticipated and I couldn't work on updating the instructions as specified in the last stand-up. ToDo: make the suggested change in organization admin PR ( https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1538 ) and finalize the instructions for hosted
02:09:48 <shlok007> version.
