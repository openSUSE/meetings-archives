15:13:03 <AEtherC0r3> Opened https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1565 which adds short_name to tracks and uses that for urls instead of the id
15:14:50 <AEtherC0r3> Rebased https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/1556 to fix conflicts and reverted the changes that where related to track urls, since #1565 will take care of it application wide
