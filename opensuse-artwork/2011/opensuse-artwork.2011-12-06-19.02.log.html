I have no idea what I'm doing here (okay that's a lie) - I used to critique/moan about artwork, started using inkscape to draw my ideas in the hope some 'proper artist' would be able to finish them off, and found I kinda enjoy it

<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:19:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> yes, I did quite a bit of the packaging for the 12.1 stuff

<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:22:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we should realize that artwork is not just limited to distro stuff

<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:23:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> I believe as a artwork team, we need to support news.oo, marketing, project, pr, ambasadors
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:24:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> do we have some sort of plan of what would be needed in terms of artwork for marketing then ?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> if not, then that's something to think about
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:24:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (maybe use bugzilla or something similar)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, what do you say if we keep this topic and sign ourselves up for this type of art over ML?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:24:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> and distro is just a piece of all thinks I believe we need to take care
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think Gnome is Using Bugzila for artwork
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:24:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro_:</span> AGREED
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:24:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> marketing materials - Presentations, CD Sleeves, Posters, Leaflets..am I forgetting anything?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:24:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> we should here define a place to ask (artwork mailing list?)
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:25:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, it's not about tool fetishism, but it's easier to have a list of requests and know whom is working on what
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:25:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bear454:</span> We are only a few memebes so most important areas should be focussed first
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yaloki, probably the best is to have artwork take on reposibilities now and over time split ourselves into teams.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ilmehtar,  that's the general bit,  but also artwork for news.o.o and other "as-needed" stuff
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> photos, screen shots, tutorials, videos...
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we don't have any quick-response opportunities
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> also, here is a question we've had asked before but never really resolved - what do you all think, should our marketing artwork be related to the distribution artwork, or should we consider an approach of 'version neutral' marketing materials?
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:25:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Vesion Neutral imho
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> requests sent to ML seem to die
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> well, you will be interacting with a lot of people (who are asking for artwork, or taking care of the packaging, etc...), so some sort of communication tool will be very helpful to track the state of things, what's TODO, etc...
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:26:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, understood
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:26:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> IMO that depends on the work.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:26:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yaloki, true that
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> define "quick-response opportunities" ?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bear454:</span> +1
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">version:</span> most version neutral, but any new openSUSE have to get some original artwork
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:27:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> Some materials can be long-lived, and should be neutral
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:27:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> jdd, that's a good thought
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:27:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> I believe we need to create a kind of templates and stardards for both situations
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:27:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> arguably, if the artwork is properly authored (layers, inkscape, ...), then it's really easy to swap out the release, the motto, etc...
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:27:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,  "I need some graphics for news..o.o"  or "I have this poster concept in mind  can someone help design it?"     Those are things that typically dont' get responded to.   What does morelikely get responded to are distro artwork stuff
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:27:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> but obviously things like counter.o.o should reflect release art
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> okay, understood, thanks
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> not  a criticism of that, just we don't have an artwork team that is equipped right now to think beyond distro
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:27:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I personally Iike the idea of both.. version neutral stuff is great, but, lets say for example presentation templates, which rare likely to be talking about a specific openSUSE version, would probably look better looking liek they derive from that version
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ilmehtar,   yes
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">19:28:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> a discussion to have, indeed
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">19:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, could we crash one of the marketing team meetings and assess the artwork needs?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:28:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> coming to distro I think that shipping of only one distro-branded wallpaper may seem strange..
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:29:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,   that isn't that simple.   a marketing team meeting wouldn't know of something that's needed 2 months from now.

<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:55:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> should we revise our color scheme?
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:55:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> no
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">19:55:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> gray/black/white are not really colors - so they are easy to get in. yellowish was also part of openSUSE artwork (11.2)
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">19:55:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> ;-) see what I said right before you asked that ;)
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">19:55:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, noted!
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">19:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> green, yelow, blue, ... I don't think we need to care about this now.
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> green is a starting point, but we can evolve (reasonably)
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:55:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> green is an awesome colour
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:55:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> we need to stablish a way to reintroduce our new phase to the world
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:55:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> jdd, +1
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:55:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yes, green is great
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:56:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I think we can make green work so well if we put our expertise to it
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:56:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> awesome, thank you all
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">19:56:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> like SUSE is here, more closed with openSUSE than ever Novell though about
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">19:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> IMHO green is a *must*
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> let me now move you to our QA section
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:56:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> so many different shades, works so well with many different things..yes its got its flaws but I've really been surprised how flexible green can be
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">19:56:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> so green is great but we need a definite way to iterate it
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">19:56:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">19:56:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> do we all agree to do QA?
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">19:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">19:56:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> yes

<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">19:57:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> First question - is a mail in from henne
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">19:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> 02:55, 24 November 2011 (MST):	Can you consider merging your IRC channel into #opensuse-project so we have less channels and everybody gets to see what you are doing?
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">19:57:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar will lead this part of the discussion as I need to check in back to work. I know, lame. :D
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">19:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> if we start a good plan, strategy for artwork, we will find the correct color for correct ocasion.
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">19:57:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> What do we all think? I actually like the idea..
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">19:57:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> \me late =(
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">19:58:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> why merge channels that are anyway temporary?
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">19:58:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> what's temporary?
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">19:59:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> temporary? this channel is permanent, requires ops, draws users, and (IMHO) seperates us 'artworkers' from lots of good feedback we could get if we conducted our business in -project
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">19:59:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> we use it only for meeting?
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">19:59:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#opensuse-artwork </span><span class="cmdline">has been around since some time, with 2 or 3 ppl on it at most</span>
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">19:59:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> no
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">19:59:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> see, it's not used much :)
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">19:59:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 for merging with the project channel
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">19:59:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, therein lies the reason for not merging
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">19:59:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">subhashish:</span> please explain, why not merge
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">19:59:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">subhashish:</span> you think we should be seperate from a source of good, active, feedback from our fellow contributors?
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">20:00:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> empty channel do not hurt
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">20:00:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> they do
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">20:00:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I endorse a merge as well,  however  I wonder if that's now not a good idea since apparently the booster team has recently un-merged itself from Project yet again
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">20:00:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> pros and cons. to merge will reduce the gap between us and the project, the cons I don't know yet :D
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">20:00:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> there could be spokespersons here
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">20:00:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Hmm did it?
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">20:01:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> do you all think that this could make us confised about artwork?
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">20:01:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but they were mostly using it to sync where to go to lunch :)
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">20:01:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there must be some underlying reason why the decision to move away from project happened as quickly as it did
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">20:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">subhashish:</span> : There is no hiearchy in openSUSE you just do what you want to do :)
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">20:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   no  they were doing more than that
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">20:01:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I am sceptical of merging, as there could be a lot of unrelated discussions, so we would miss out the interesting art-related part
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">20:01:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bmwiedemann,   then make the artwork channel more interesting  :-)
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">20:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> here's my take - we make artwork, we're awesome, but our artwork has a huge impact across the project. taking our (quiet IRC channel) and merging it with -project is an opportunty to get more people involved in artwork discussions and more visibility to the awesome work we're doing
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">20:02:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> hm
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">20:02:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> what about merging marketing and artwork then?
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">20:02:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> marketing is a bit more active than artwork
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">20:02:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> you make a fine point, but I think the -artwork ML should be kept and serious, non-instant discussions should be kept there..
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">20:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> okay, I like that better
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">20:02:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> right now i'm out of reasons to prpose for a different channel
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">20:02:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> don't think so many people will look at it. We can advertise metting on the project list. cookbook messages do not interest project
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">20:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> Ilmehtar I like your points, but I think could be not so perfect like appears to be
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">20:03:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jdd,   but IRC is used for more than just meetings
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">20:03:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its a place where people have "hallway discussions" which are usually the most fruitful
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">20:03:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> IRC is a lot more about social interaction, actually
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">20:03:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro_:</span> I think yaloki 's marketing idea is a happy medium between henne's suggestion and keeping things how they are
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">20:03:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> yes, but this part is what I call cookbook
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">20:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> not of general interest
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">20:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> both are fine
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">20:03:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that's what we do on all the other channels
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">20:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's a mix of both focused discussions on a specific topic, and more social interaction
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">20:04:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> yes, it's why I do not read them :-))
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">20:04:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> hummm, right
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">20:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> Ilmehtar,  agreed
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">20:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> please apply the same reasoning when you post to the mailing-lists then, thank you ;)
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">20:04:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> IRC can work only with little writers
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:04:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> look
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">20:04:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the thing is
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">20:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> let's be honest
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">20:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the artwork and marketing teams don't have the visibility they deserve, right now, in the project
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">20:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">20:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">20:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> on the mailing list one can remove unusefull mails on one second, on IRC it mixes with others messages
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">20:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> being isolated with 4, 5 people on a channel of your own is not going to hepl
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">20:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> err, "help" even
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">20:05:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> hi marcus :)
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">20:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> hi all
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">20:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> hello marcus
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">20:05:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> unuseful mails kill this project
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">20:05:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> ;)
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">20:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so I think that's a lot behind the reasoning of merging channels too
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">20:06:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, have you already started (sorry, am a bit late, had to do some sports ;))
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">20:06:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> less channels mean more visibility, interaction, networking
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">20:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> it's not my vision, but it's not the place to discuss this
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">20:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> the plan is to merge marketing and artwork?
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">20:06:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> yep
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">20:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> hmm
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">20:06:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> the main problem i see here that artists need to talk to artists
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">20:06:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> not 'plan', more 'discussion'
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">20:06:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> would at least make more sense in terms of topic
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">20:06:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> I mean, project and artwork
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">20:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> and not mainly to marketing ppl
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">20:07:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> I disagree
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">20:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> as you are a marketing guy, yep
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">20:07:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> yes, but being 3 or 4 people on an island and not interact with other people in the project can't be the best option either
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">20:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> marketing needs artwork and artists need to know about the needs of marketing
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">20:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> yes, it might be special in this little group of ppl
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">20:07:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> that's a little harsh I think, I think its fair to say I've done my fair share of artwork as well
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">20:07:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> but only saying things like it has to be more green are not useful for artists, anyhow
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">20:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> My only question is how will we mentor new people if we are restricted in little groups
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">20:08:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> guys, this is almost the same situation we had in the past with ambassadors
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">20:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, ok you got two souls ;)
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">20:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> that sounds pretty elitist, to put it gently
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">20:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> not really
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">20:08:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> if it's not to work as part of a project, an island is fine too ;)
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">20:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> marketing could help us to find more artists, of course
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">20:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> as said, it's also about interaction, visibility
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">20:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> anyway is that so important? Merge it if you want :-)
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">20:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> you dont think the artwork team need more sources of feedback?
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">20:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> how?
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">20:09:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so people know what others are working on, and such
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">20:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> +1
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">20:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> there are plenty of marketing ppl on the artwork list atm
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">20:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> you think we're currently doing fine and dont need more contributors or people to help with ideas, suggestions, and maybe even their own art?
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">20:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well yes, that's called "duplication", I believe  :)
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">20:09:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i think we need more artists
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">20:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> not talkers
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">20:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> we probably have lots of artist around us, and we are not seein them because we are like in a island
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">20:09:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> at least in this group
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">20:10:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> is that an irc channel problem?
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">20:10:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro_, then let the marketing team help us to find them
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">20:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> jdd, nope
<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">20:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> how are we going to get more artists if our artwork group act like an elite group who shun others feedback and help?
<a name="l-508"></a><span class="tm">20:10:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> again we are not elite
<a name="l-509"></a><span class="tm">20:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> then stop acting like it
<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">20:10:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> we need more visibility, not comments
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">20:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> um
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">20:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> How do we get visibility?
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">20:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> pick your island then
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">20:10:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, i am not acting like this, you are just getting me wrong
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">20:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> I think we need both
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">20:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> to get visibility we have to show artwork
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">20:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> and therefor we need artists
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">20:11:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> thats the main point atm
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">20:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> no, therefore we need people to see artwork..
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">20:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> its a recursion :)
<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">20:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> and to get artists we need attraction (e.g. prices)
<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">20:11:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> we have some (no me :-), and have to show they work (there I can)
<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">20:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> prizes as in?
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">20:11:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> winning concept gets an bamboo tablet (e.g.)
<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">20:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> we need to create something that cause impact is what we need, imho
<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">20:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but afaics marcus is the only one who disagrees so far, at least to the proposal to make #opensuse-artwork a forward to #opensuse-marketing
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">20:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> Also we are all about contributing
<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">20:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> ? henne said project?
<a name="l-529"></a><span class="tm">20:12:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jdd:</span> yes, but we could merge it with marketing too
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">20:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> yaloki, i do not totally disagree, it just does not solve our main problems
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">20:12:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> might make more sense
<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">20:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> why  not?
<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">20:12:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> that's true, but there are many "problems" / things to improve :)
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">20:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it does not improve things to have more ppl commenting on few contributions
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">20:13:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i am not sure if marketing and ambassadors are already merged, but that makes sense imho
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">20:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but it enhances visibility in the project, and interest, and feedback, and possibly more contributors
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">20:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> we can comment, but also publish on mailing lists, facebook, google+, wiki, flyers
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">20:14:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> yaloki, maybe
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">20:14:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> What marcus is trying to say here is a lot of people commenting puts a lot of stress on the few people working on these artworks, do I get you right?
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">20:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> humm . dependes of the quality of contributions, don't you think?
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">20:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> may be we could give more visible credit to the artists that did the good job
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">20:14:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i would agree that we could give it a try, but i personally do not expect that big outcome
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">20:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> manugupt1, you got it
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">20:15:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> like with my drafts for 12.1 artwork where some people said, it should be brighter, while others wanted it darker :D
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">20:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i personally did not even get a thanks, for the heavy work i did in the last few month
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">20:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> bmwiedemann, jup
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">20:15:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> guys I have to go.  Looking forward to seeing how you guys end up
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">20:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> thats what i mean
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">20:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> see, my point, visibility ;)
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">20:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> numbers of ppl and contributions is important, of course, but if withou quality I think you are right, we will get lots of comments and few positive help feedback
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">20:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> really? that's surprising, I got tons of thanks..
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">20:15:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> I think everyone spoke of those wallpapers as yours in mailing lists that is credibility :)
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">20:15:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> how about we give it a try
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">20:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we can always go back to segregation
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">20:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> as mentioned, i think we could give it a try
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">20:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> I think we should give it a try
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">20:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> fine
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">20:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> go
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">20:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;subhashish&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">20:16:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> can i bring up the next topic?
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">follow-up merging -artwork with either -project or -marketing IRC channel</span>
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:16:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> we're at the QA section, so shoot
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">let's try to merge #opensuse-artwork with #opensuse-marketing, and see in a few weeks how it turns out, can always go back if it doesn't</span>
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jdd&gt;</span> and I have to go. See you on the mailing list (artwork) for licence discussion
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">20:17:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, i want to limit the work, we have to do in the artwork sig (as we are so few ppl atm)
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">20:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> sig?
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">20:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> sig??
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">20:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> fedora slang for team :)
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">20:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> so the idea is to create a basic artwork for grub / boot / maybe login manager
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">20:18:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> and only customize the wallpaper
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">20:18:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> special intrest group
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">20:18:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> you mean release agnostic
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">20:18:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> Did you share your students work at ml.. I think it will be great if you do so :)
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">20:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> if i would know what agnostic means maybe yaloki
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">20:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it should be release safe
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">20:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> means same for every release
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">20:19:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> making artwork that isn't changed when new releases are released..
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">20:19:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> ah I meant independent of the release
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">20:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> we discussed the idea of release agnostic stuff earlier on..
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">20:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> jup
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">20:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i thing this would improve a lot of things
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">20:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> at least for now
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">20:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> till we are more contributors
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">20:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but as I understood, reviewers really liked the consistent theme
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">20:20:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">20:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> the general feeling seemed to be along the idea of using more release agnostic artwork but still keeping somethings release specific - I'm not sure I share your feeling we dont have enough to do the current workload though
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">20:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> makes sense as a fallback plan, imho
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">20:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, so it should be green ;)
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">20:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">20:20:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and I thought, coolo did some scripting to make many artwork/branding parts from one source
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">20:20:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> would argue that picking a good 'easy to work with' art for the core wallpaper would also help make the load less
<a name="l-593"></a><span class="tm">20:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> bmwiedemann, it still was a LOT of work
<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">20:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's definitely a valid way to approach it, but maybe we should first see who can take care of what before we jump to the assumption we're not enough people
<a name="l-595"></a><span class="tm">20:21:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> correct - making too much rrelease agnostic would actually make more work for packagers like me
<a name="l-596"></a><span class="tm">20:21:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, that was not the point at least not for this release
<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">20:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I mean, a lack of organization (which needs some time to get into place) causes a lot more work for everyone too
<a name="l-598"></a><span class="tm">20:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> because we'd have to uncarve all the scripting for the branding packages ;-)
<a name="l-599"></a><span class="tm">20:22:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> no, it oculd still be in the branding package Ilmehtar
<a name="l-600"></a><span class="tm">20:22:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it's more about a workflow
<a name="l-601"></a><span class="tm">20:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Hmm..
<a name="l-602"></a><span class="tm">20:23:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So if I get it right we have 2 things here
<a name="l-603"></a><span class="tm">20:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> 1. Less no of contributors
<a name="l-604"></a><span class="tm">20:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> some of us artists might not want to follow the same workflow as you..less work is great, but I for one am willing to help out more.. I found it difficult to get involved in some aspects of the 12.1 artwork for reasons totally non-technical..
<a name="l-605"></a><span class="tm">20:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> 2. Identify issues to minimize the effort
<a name="l-606"></a><span class="tm">20:24:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I believe that a lot of improvements can be made in terms of organization
<a name="l-607"></a><span class="tm">20:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro_&gt;</span> brb
<a name="l-608"></a><span class="tm">20:24:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> Still no harm in minimizing effort
<a name="l-609"></a><span class="tm">20:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that already lowers part of the work
<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">20:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, i asked you for some contributions like the libre office splash
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">20:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> agreed :)
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">20:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> which i still had to do on my own
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">20:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and that's not just for the artwork team, but everyone and their interaction with the artwork team
<a name="l-614"></a><span class="tm">20:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> atm, i think it will be again a lot of strees to do a streamline design for 12.2
<a name="l-615"></a><span class="tm">20:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> unless we get more contributors and clearly define who does what
<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">20:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> well precisely, having a somewhat more structured approach will definitely help on that too
<a name="l-617"></a><span class="tm">20:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> there?
<a name="l-618"></a><span class="tm">20:25:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> yes you did, but given I couldnt' find any of the current sources, it did make things rather difficult - this goes back to my earlier points that we should be doing stuff more openly and easily for people to contribute
<a name="l-619"></a><span class="tm">20:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> I shouldn't be needing to email you to get the correct versions of the openSUSE logo for example
<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">20:26:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> me did not had any sources, too. just designed one on my own
<a name="l-621"></a><span class="tm">20:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> also, as an aside, I still find it ironic that the libre office splash was our only bit of version neutral art in 11.4 and you decided that needed changing :)
<a name="l-622"></a><span class="tm">20:26:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, i agree on that, but thats robers false
<a name="l-623"></a><span class="tm">20:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> manugupt1, yes but on the phone :D
<a name="l-624"></a><span class="tm">20:26:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> aeh robert
<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">20:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. Lets start figuring out solutions but not point out :)
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">20:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">20:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> just wanted to mention as Ilmehtar asked for more work :/
<a name="l-628"></a><span class="tm">20:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Does that sound good to everyone Ilmehtar yaloki marcus
<a name="l-629"></a><span class="tm">20:26:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yes, we need to get robert more involved on a few points too
<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">20:27:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and make sure material, guidelines (including licensing) and such are easily available for all
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">20:27:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">20:27:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-633"></a><span class="tm">20:27:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it's not only about being involved but speaking about it.
<a name="l-634"></a><span class="tm">20:27:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that's certainly not the case right now
<a name="l-635"></a><span class="tm">20:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> would be nice, if we could have all artwork images in one place (e.g. git checkout) and get it into the right packages/places easily
<a name="l-636"></a><span class="tm">20:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> the git repo is already well structured
<a name="l-637"></a><span class="tm">20:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> yep
<a name="l-638"></a><span class="tm">20:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> at least for 12.1

<a name="l-640"></a><span class="tm">20:28:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> only the counter banners are not in there
<a name="l-641"></a><span class="tm">20:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I think it should be thrown away
<a name="l-642"></a><span class="tm">20:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's way too large
<a name="l-643"></a><span class="tm">20:28:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it contains a lot of useful stuff
<a name="l-644"></a><span class="tm">20:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> contains artifacts (e.g. 80% of the size of the repo is PDFs that are just rendered from SVGs)
<a name="l-645"></a><span class="tm">20:28:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> The git repo??
<a name="l-646"></a><span class="tm">20:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> the release subdir only contains release specific stuff
<a name="l-647"></a><span class="tm">20:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-648"></a><span class="tm">20:29:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> there is nothing to throw away in there.
<a name="l-649"></a><span class="tm">20:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> well something like spideroak would be seriously more helpgul
<a name="l-650"></a><span class="tm">20:29:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yaloki, would it be ok if we also took this discussion to robert and then make the change?
<a name="l-651"></a><span class="tm">20:29:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> mm.. only for read access
<a name="l-652"></a><span class="tm">20:29:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but that's really a topic of its own
<a name="l-653"></a><span class="tm">20:29:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and it's not an easy one
<a name="l-654"></a><span class="tm">20:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i am fine with the repo as it is atm
<a name="l-655"></a><span class="tm">20:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> 2GB of checkout

<a name="l-668"></a><span class="tm">20:31:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> and it's something that should be worked out on the mailing-list ;)
