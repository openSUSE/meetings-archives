<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> before getting to this let me explain something
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:40:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm Richard, from England, I seem to get myself involved in tons of stuff, currently artwork, marketing, gnome, and the ambassador programme.. I alsouse a lot of Novell/SUSE stuff in the office, so I get to see stuff from tons of different angles
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> and..yup, now we can move on ;-)
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> my name is marcus (as you can see from my nick ;)) and i am living in Switzerland.  I am a linux user since the early 90th and did a lot of contributions (not only to opensuse). suse related activities are listed on my connect page
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> a couple of days ago someone entered our voting poll and delete quite a few of the votes from it. What we had not realized was that anyone who has a doodle account and participates in a poll can do that. So, it's my bad for being so naive. But fortunately we have a vote count history and the newer votes I have the results
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:42:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> you can find our candidates here http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Wallpapers
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:42:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> now the results in order
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:43:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> these are the number of votes from the first design to the last
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> 25
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:43:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> 21

<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:43:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> 46
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:43:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> that means, marcus and Ilmehtar are the winners!!!!!
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:44:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it's an awesome design!
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:44:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> with lightray
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:44:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> 56 being lightrays, and 51 and 46 being two of your chamleon designs?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> that is accurate, yes
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:44:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> which were the ones that got 38 and 30? just curious.. nice to see such a spread on the vote
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar went ahead and predicted his design to be the winner :) so he has done some work with this design already and will try to put it in ML 1 next week
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:45:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> well, since Ilmehtar has already started using lightrays and seeing how it's coming on top, I think we should stick with it
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:46:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> that was the swirls wallpaper by me and opensuse 1 by lars gardmo
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> definitively, Ilmehtar knows how to package them :D
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> curiosity - why call it 'lightrays'? there are no rays there :)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> ray tracing ?
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:47:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> it is a special ray that is swirling around :)
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> hrhr
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:47:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> looks more like some sort of a vegetation
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it is a ray of light coming from above letting the geeko shine
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:48:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> depends on the viewers eyes i guess ;)
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:48:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> anyhow
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:48:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> and understanding of physics :P
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:48:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> should we offer suggestions to be worked on the wallpaper that marcus created ?
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:48:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'd like to propose actually packaging those top 4 who didn't make it in some sort of 'wallpapers-extra' package for 12.2 - as these will be straight wallpapers all I'd need would be the design, in the 4 resolutions/aspect ratios we use (16:9, 16:10, 5:4, and 4:3)
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:49:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> well it'
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:49:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> well it's rather flat at the moment, so some texture would do it well
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:49:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> we can also call it swirls
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:49:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> that would be great
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:49:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> a little colour management and probably that will do
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:49:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> do you have checked out the svg already?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:49:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I like that idea
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:50:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, what 4 who didn't make it do you mean?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> you can also move or modify the swirls a bit if you want
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> alright
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:51:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> I'd like to have your 2 chamelon designs, and your swirls, and opensuse 1 in the wallpaper-extras package we're going to put together - having only 2 wallpapers in there doesn't seem like 'enough' to me, and a few extra wont hurt :)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:51:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> should we move to assignments?
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> the only not know yet is the packaging for plymouth which has a chance to enter in factory ...
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:51:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> sounds good
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:51:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> will talk about that with fcrozat at fosdem ...
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> please let me know what do you want me to do with the design of my wallpapers to make them more awesome
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it-s-PC, here you will find the svg source: http://www.marcusmoeller.ch/share/oS/12_2/opensuse_lightray_nologo.svg
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:52:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> it's not yet in the git repo ?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:52:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> thanks
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:52:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> they're in the git repo :)
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:52:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I will provide my sources shortly
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> okay.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:52:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I put them there today, along with the sources for everything I've used the design in :)
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:52:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> cool, thanks
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:53:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> cool, don't forget to add a new size for openSUSE - ARM :D
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:53:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> team, can you give me a couple of suggestions to make my designs better?
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> anditosan, was it you who made the photos of the geeko?
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:53:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i guess it is yours, isn't it?
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:53:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> the chameleon is mine too :D
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:54:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> when it comes to resizing/reuse of lightrays, all I've done is the odd tweak to the gradient to make sure it still gets darker near the edges, and I've resized all of the 'rays' but keeping them proportional.. that should make it pretty easy for us to swap out and change
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:54:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, the background on the photo whith the big chameleon is way to light

<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:57:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it-s-PC, of course. i made it for that

<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:57:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> as of right now, bootsplash, kdm, and the gnome dynamic wallpapers are the only things that dont have a 'lightrays version' done in our git repo
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:58:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> is plymouth switch set, already?
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:58:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> bootsplash is not that difficult with scripts laying in -art repo
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:58:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> no, it's not, so we're still assuming bootsplash for now
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:58:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:58:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> are we looking to have the same design image in accross all these modules, kdm, gdm, splash screen?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> plymouth is only an option, but it seems fcrozat will try to get it in factory,
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> bootsplash?
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:58:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> yes, but I'm having to dig out some really old scripts as this design calls for the logo to be in the middle :) which is cool
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:59:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> someone has to touch thread about Plymouth to get answers fast
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm fine doing the gnome dynamic wallpapers (though suggestions on what transitions/effects/colours to use would be great) - I'm also okay with doing the bootsplash unless someone else wants to take it on
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:59:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> the wallpaper / login / splash should not contain the geeko, only the bootsplash
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:59:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm least happy about doing kdm
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:59:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> we will see Frédéric at fosdem next week.end
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:59:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> the wallpaper / login / splash will not contain the geeko
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">20:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok, so they will be different than the wallpaper?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">20:00:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> for kdm this time we have to integrate all optionnal things, like the ad login, users list etc ... to avoid the missed part in 12.1
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">20:00:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, just place the geeko in the middle and a status bar below. there has been themes like that. if i find one, i will send you a template
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">20:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> is there a way that we can design a custom kde/gnome bootsplash to show difference between the wallpaper and the loading process? this was pointed out by suseROCKs and darkmatter
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">20:01:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> that's the plan, I'm digging out the old scripts from 11.1 which followed that model :) I don't think it'll be a problem, just a fun learning curve for me
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">20:01:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, fine
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">20:01:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> anditosan, at least there will be a status bar on it
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">20:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> marcus, that would be awesome. Some members of the community mentioned to me that they wanted to see difference between the wallpaper and the window manager loading modules
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">20:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> one thing on plymouth - plymouth wont be in milestone 1, so it's probably not worth worrying about it now.. this 'crunch' to get things packaged for Thursday is so we can get MS1 out there with at least somethign that will resemble our finished designs - if it-s-PC and others are going to change lightrays, that's cool, more fun work but plenty of time before release to get it in there :)
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">20:03:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> I wasn't planning on doing anything about it for now :)
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">20:03:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, we will have to make sure to contact other members that work with plymouth. To date, it has never worked on my laptop or any other computer I have installed it on
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">20:03:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">20:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok I believe this solves part 4 of our meeting

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">20:04:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> it-s-PC, so we are already waiting for the first results ;)

<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">20:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> as long as we keep all the relevant sources in git and keep everyone in touch with what others are doing, I'm really quite excited about how much further ahead we already are on 12.2 than we were at at this stage of 12.1 :)
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">20:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> who's taking on kdm..anyone?

<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">20:12:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> we all have some ideas about artwork and the team. I heard one from it-s-PC recently and we would like to hear some more about it
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">20:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it-s-PC could you propose the idea we discussed?
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">20:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> especially since I just walked into the meeting  :-)
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">20:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> i still got the idea to offer a little gift for the winning concept (at least next time), e.g. a bamboo tablet or something like that
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">20:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> we discussed a few of those :)
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">20:13:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it-s-PC, hehe then the most relevant?
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">20:13:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> sorry guys, before that suseROCKs has a question?
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">20:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Are we only discussing relating to 12.1 artwork or general artwork stuff?
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">20:13:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> well as i mentioned before I would like to make sure there are better guidelines in place, but this is a long term goal
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">20:14:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, nostly 12.2
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">20:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ops  I meant 12.2   :-)
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">20:14:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, yes
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">20:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we are coming to the general discussion now with ideas and then later with our Q&amp;A
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">20:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> The reason I ask is because we will have a request very soon to the artwork team to design some posters for distribution beginning March 1 to promote the openSUSE Conference in Orlando
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">20:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I think that having a general per release design idea would help improve the aim of the team in general
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">20:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok then I will hold off until then
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">20:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> for instance, you know how Ubuntu got those release names?
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">20:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, camy agrees with you
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">20:15:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">it-s-PC:</span> we have release names in openSUSE
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">20:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I know, but they are internal for the dev team
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">20:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> and they are mostly ugly ;)
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">20:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I would like to propose our own "release name" just for the art team

<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">20:16:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> how this will work is that - right before the new release cycle we would get together and pick a "theme" to follow for the release

<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">20:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> for instance if we had a theme like "Origami" for this release
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">20:17:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> it would make everyone's life so much easier
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">20:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> in terms of creating a wallpaper
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">20:17:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> one common ground we agreed on was that it has to be green
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">20:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> making sure the whole of distro looks somewhat "origami-ish"
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">20:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> etc
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">20:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I'm not debating the base color :)
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">20:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it-s-PC, +1
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">20:18:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> then i would suggest to find better internal names and use these
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">20:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> not just a name for the art team.
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">20:18:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I'm proposing a design detection set
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">20:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm not so sure..
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">20:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> I think we shouldn't impose on the dev team
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">20:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> don't get me wrong, I like the idea, I get where you're coming from and if we were a larger team, I'd be fully behind it
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">20:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> who obviously has their own agenda
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">20:19:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> it has nothing to do with the team size
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">20:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> however, we're not a large team, and this is the first time we've been able to really get a solid number of submissions from the wider community to consider as part of the artwork process
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">20:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> I mean right now look at the wallpaper submissions you got
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">20:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">it-s-PC:</span> a design detection set ??
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">20:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">it-s-PC:</span> go on :)
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">20:20:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it-s-PC, I like the idea of having a theme for the team. I would suggest however to make sure that contributions made by new members be directed that way too. Many times they are new to the team and do not know about these ideas.
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">20:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> there is no basic idea there. they are all just random splashes of someone's creative mind
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">20:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> but, if there was an idea behind it
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">20:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> it would make the artist's life so much easier
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">20:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">it-s-PC:</span> what's wrong with the random splashes? hmm..
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">20:21:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> they are random
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">20:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> theming a distro is not easy
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">20:21:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> so you're saying,  you think we got less submissions than we could have, because we weren't giving potential artists a starting point to begin making their submissions from?
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">20:21:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> you sit there not sure where to start
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">20:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> where to get inspiration from
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">20:21:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> what should it look like
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">20:21:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> absolutely
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">20:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> here is an example
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">20:22:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> I come to you and say Ilmehtar - make me a picture
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">20:22:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> no no, I get ya
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">20:22:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> how do you know what to do now?
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">20:22:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> and I see your point
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">20:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> but then if I asked you to make me a picture of a sunset - now you have a basic idea
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">20:22:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> but I'll counter with this - I agree, we should have a theme, but I'd like to still accept submissions that dont match that theme too
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">20:23:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> it-s-PC, Ilmehtar, at the same time, having a theme helps branding. People can recignize openSUSE better through unified visual cues
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">20:23:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> clues
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">20:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm not sure if theme = branding
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">20:23:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> note for bot, ask coolo if he accept to share the creation of release name, perhaps it's boring him afterall ?
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">20:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> ah no, branding has nothing to do with this :)
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">20:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, for sure! I am also trying to see if more artists join us that way. I offer my help to the new people all the time
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">20:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;marcus&gt;</span> ok, guys i am off for now. let me know if you need something.
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">20:24:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">marcus:</span> good day
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">20:24:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> branding is a consistency throughout all releases, whereas a theme is unique to a specific release (or event)

<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">20:40:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I dont want an imaginary desktop X though.. I like my GNOME 3 desktop, I embrace what that entails, the differences it has from other desktops, and I think there is nothing wrong with openSUSE offering that whole suite of offerings...difference isn't bad :)
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">20:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> tigerfoot, so true!
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">20:40:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> but what's cool, is I can if I want ...
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">20:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> and still after our discussion I know that you dislike the default GNOME3 app launcher
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">20:40:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I should point out that there's a few themes being packaged with GNOME 3.4 which for some reason cannot run in test in 3.2.
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">20:41:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> just let me my freedom ... look at my car :D
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">20:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so whatever you're doing may require a bit of retesting once 3.4 development in factory is ready soon
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">20:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> and that gave me a few pointers

<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">20:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> that was the idea No 2
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">20:41:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;it-s-PC&gt;</span> to get the feel of the community

<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">20:46:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> please ask our team for artwork, or ideas that you do not seem to understand
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">20:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, please do!
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">20:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> As many of you know, SUSECon will have its first conference in September in Orlando
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">20:46:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Immediately following that will be the first ever US Conference of openSUSE
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">20:46:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> This coming wed we will have a kickoff/planning committee meeting
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">20:46:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> the 20th of SUSE too
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">20:47:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> However, we will need to advertise very early on
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">20:47:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we need posters, banners, etc. ready by March 1.
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">20:47:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If someone from artwork team would kindly join in on Wed's meeting and get some ideas so we can have quick turnaround, that would be awesome
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">20:47:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, will your team also discuss design ideas for their ads?

<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">20:48:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,  at most, the team may/or should discuss a theme
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">20:48:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I'm going to try to not let it become long-winded discussion because frankly we don't have time for it

<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Well we'll need someone who can and has the computing power to design movie-style posters because we are going to many events beginning in March-May in the US
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">20:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It's important we advertise as early as possible with posters, and online banners
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">20:49:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we can discuss specific size/dimensional requirements later this week
