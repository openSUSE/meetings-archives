16:04:39 <ddemaio> It looks like design 6 is the clear winner
16:05:21 <ddemaio> I'm in contact with the tshirt vendor and will order by next week.
16:05:47 <ddemaio> Since we have ARM and Fedora on a blue tshirt, we'll need like in indigo blue
16:05:55 <ddemaio> something that contrasts a little
16:06:29 <ddemaio> Any other blues we might want to think about
16:06:32 <ddemaio> ?

16:29:44 <thomic> sorry . i were off due to workstuff
16:29:45 <thomic> :)
16:29:49 <thomic> any questions ddemaio ?
16:30:46 <thomic> ddemaio Leo-14 one hint - please decide on artwork as early as possible - as we need to do the video-intros etc and prepare that
16:30:49 <ddemaio> I don't think so. Is there anything you need me to push
16:30:53 <thomic> :)
16:30:59 <thomic> that's the only one for now
16:31:10 <thomic> and if you need me to pick up things at teamix-office
16:31:15 <thomic> i'm living next to it
16:31:17 <thomic> just ping me
16:31:31 <ddemaio> thomic: do you know the teamix guys
16:31:51 <thomic> ddemaio: jup - as they are our partner i know a few of them
16:31:58 <ddemaio> I was going to do it, but it's across town from me and I don't know them
16:31:59 <thomic> but deckel has better connections
16:32:10 <thomic> i was at their office 2 times now
16:32:15 <thomic> they should know me :)
16:32:28 <ddemaio> cool. When deckel hears form them, can you pick them up and drop them off
16:32:35 <thomic> so it's no problem to drop stuff in my car and bring it here
16:32:37 <thomic> to a locked room
16:32:39 <ddemaio> If you need a ride, let me know
16:32:48 <thomic> nah i'm going by car anyways
