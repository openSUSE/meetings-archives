Are there any questions regarding those or do we need to discuss anything in detail? Or does anyone wants to give a live status report of something?

<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Things that float around in your brain  :-)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> brain? ;)
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 'nuff said  :-)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well no one has done any artwork or packaging around that topic
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so they are dangling
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is there a blocker or do we need to re-push it?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:11:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have no one doing it
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats the blocker
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:11:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> es
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and as long as we don't have the "based on opensuse" artwork in packages
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we need to reach out and find people who can do the tasks
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I saw Coolo doeing something there.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we can't apply the changes to the guidelines
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> you saw coolo doing what where?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> Checkc package branding-basedonopensuse
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> it's in factory
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   he saw him doing that there  :-)

<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:13:18 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">looks</span>
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:13:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so best step is to poke coolo and see what he's up to and if we can proceed from there
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:13:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> of course we can
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> poke poke!  :-D
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:13:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> so what exactly did you do? the artwork?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> the artwork and the packaging :)
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> I created a package that takes all branding-openSUSE packages and creates branding-basedonsuse packages from it replacing all artwork
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:14:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> .o0( coolo did artwork )
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> Could you spell openSUSE correctly i nthe packagename, please?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> where there is a geeko, there will be a "based on opensuse" text in nice wine red
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> no, it's not openSUSE after all
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> is this on git artwork repo?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:15:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> cool
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:15:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> it's a branch I didn't push
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> I'm waiting for rlihm to move to github
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:15:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> where can we see that artwork?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:15:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> oh ok
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> grab yourself a factory live cd and install branding-basedonsuse
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:16:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> onopensuse
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We should probably do what we can to expedite usage and update our gudelines as I can think of at least some who will need this artwork soon with the 12.1 release coming up
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:17:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I was not sure what exactly is required from the artwork, but I wanted to give this whole stunt a starting point
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:17:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span>  I will , thanks

<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:17:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> coolo,  and we all appreciate you pushed it forward.  Truly!
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> does this enclude artwork for 12.1 cover?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Welcome Mr. AlanClark
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I also changed the KDE unstable livecd to use it, so we have a test bed
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   No  this is for "based on"
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> alright
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:18:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> let's update the AIs then
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:18:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Medias/images/iso/

<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:18:52 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">assigns henne to update the AI's then</span>
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   "based on" means it is not original.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeah ok but are we going to adopt that?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> let me create a screenshot
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,  For example.  If you created a special distro called "Kosta's Amazing Greek CD" and it uses openSUSE, then you would use "Based on..."
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok, then another artwork question, do we have artwork for 12.1?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it is for third parties to use our products and trademarks with proper recognition and permissions in the guidelines
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:20:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> sorry I was abit off things for a while

<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> .o0( too much fire )

<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> just two short lines: AJaeger has sent me a mail where he explains what difficulties can come up when shipping gifts world-wide

<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:28:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes gramp
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so the two board AI's really aren't moving at this time so I think there's nothing to discuss
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:28:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the second one is just open for documentation purposes ;)
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:28:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> What about susebugreporter?
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:28:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Pretty much  LOL
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:29:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I know I need to move on the first one
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:29:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   What about it?
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:29:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Well it was a soc project dont know much but can be used I guess
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> brb
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:30:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's kind of a different topic
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:30:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's talk about GCI now
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Google Code-In</span>
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:31:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. Who speaks?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:31:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So we have an action item to look into GCI when it becomes announced and according to manugupt1 it is now announced.
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:31:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  if you'd like to lead this topic, the floor is yours
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2011
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:32:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> yes it has been, the problem is we never had any sort of junior jobs ( although it was said we had) it is a perfect time to start  them
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> sure
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we do have a junior jobs page (though I don't recall the link offhand)   but we most definitely can focus on it to create more opportunities.
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:33:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> AIs regarding this is making a junior jobs page
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> maybe use google to find it
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  but my biggest concern right now is the timieline (I cannot read it legibly on the website) but last year's occured during xmas holidays
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I dont think it is good enough, I could never understand it personally
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:33:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> just an idea ;)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:34:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> http://en.opensuse.org/Junior_jobs
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so can someone read the timeline on google's site and tell what the timeline is?
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> ok.. so  I would like people to work on things that they think can be done easily specially by respective teams and the idea is to divide tasks into 3 parts
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:35:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> manugupt1 - how do we get those Junior_jobs listed on GCI?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:35:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> November 9, 2011: Open Source Projects are announced
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:35:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> November 21, 2011, 12:00 AM Pacific Time / 08:00 UTC: Contest opens for entries by student participants
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:36:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> Same as last time when we submit the application basically GCI focussees on code refractoring, documentation, community management , translation, bug reports etc
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:36:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> January 16, 2012, 12:00 AM Pacific Time / 08:00 UTC: All work stops
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so that means people work on their projects between Nov 21 and Jan 16, right?
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what else would it mean?
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:36:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if so, then that's actually better and more workable than last year's which was a 2 week period occurring during xmas holidays
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:37:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So while we have a vague list of things but in the next week we need atleast some tasks ( divided into 3 categories like easy,medium and difficult)
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:37:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and ending on some insane date like Jan 3rd or something
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:37:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Now, I need to know who can volunteer for this
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well manugupt1   you're jumping the gun just a little bit here....
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:38:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the first quesiton is what teams do we poke to ask them to come up with their lists of junior jobs and willing mentors
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ok.. what did I miss
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:38:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Yes.. that is what I was going to do next
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:39:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I have read your mail, maybe improving the website could go there?
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:39:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what I would like to see us do today is decide who owns this initiative and let that person drive it
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:39:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (could be manugupt1?)
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:39:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I cannot look into all teams..
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   no  I mean to drive the GCI initiative.  You can certainly ask people to assist you in poking teams
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:39:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I would like team leaders from the team to decide what is most important for them
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:39:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can you look into finding someone who can?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:39:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't have team leaders
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:39:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But we need someone who takes the accountability for this
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:39:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we're not a company
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:40:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I mean who know the most or work a lot on it
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> looks to me manugupt1 already volunteered to drive the issue ;)
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:40:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure sounded like it, robjo  :-)
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:40:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I can but there are some dates when I wont be available so I need one more person during that time
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   I can help you

<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">18:52:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> Than we decided to start a 12.1 Milestone
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">18:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we also worked on revamping the obs.org webpage
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">18:52:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> were we will spend some time on the 12.1 release and help wherever help is needed
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">18:52:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d1g1tltom&gt;</span> and doing screencasts :-)
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">18:53:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ie. updating the infrastructure, bugfixing, triaging, fixing texts here and there, marketing and such
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">18:53:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah you can see some nice OBS screencasts on digitltoms vimeo page: http://vimeo.com/digitaltom
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">18:53:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'd like to mention that dragotin and I had a discussion earlier today about how to better collaborate and keep each other informed between what boosters and marketing team do so we can double our efforts rather than duplicate them
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">18:53:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> everybody can see the planning of the efforts at http://retro.opensuse.org
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">18:53:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> no account needed
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">18:53:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we had a productive discussion and will lead to more frutful collaboration in the future.
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">18:54:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, so whenever you have the feeling a booster is disturbing your work, beat him up and than tell me and I do it even harder
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">18:54:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ...except if its me ;_)
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">18:54:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   you hae to promise to videotape that!
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">18:54:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> everything is video-taped and syncronised by henne
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">18:54:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">18:55:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok any other statuses to report?
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">18:55:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> .o0( actually he tried to do a video-sync today 10000times in our office)
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">18:55:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> dragotin - way cool stuff. thanks for the urls
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">18:55:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> expect some detailed report about the finished milestone soon
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">18:55:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and again, please if something seems strange what we do, please speak up frankly and quickly
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">18:56:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   what if we just simply think you're strange?
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">18:56:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and suseROCKs volunteered to double check the retro list if we already interfere with somebody somewhere - thanks for that
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">18:56:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">18:57:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so we have all the status reports we could possibly get now except for one...  Election Committee
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">18:57:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff, can you give us a status on that?

<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">18:59:54 </span><span class="nka">* AlanClark</span> <span class="ac">notes that the rest of the world reads calendars backwards</span>
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">18:59:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I think the dates are up at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election

<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">19:00:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well ok

<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">19:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">19:00:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is this widely announced yet?
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">19:00:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ISO format please :)
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">19:00:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">19:01:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   what does DVDs have to do with this?  You're off topic!  :-)
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">19:01:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so we think that we will anounce oficially on lists around the 28 of Octomber
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">19:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> good work, thanks
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">19:01:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah combine those announcements
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">19:01:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">19:01:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   You should announce before then so people can prepare and think about it before standing up
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">19:02:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we will also make the announcement on news
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">19:02:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they have a month to think about it
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">19:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/iso-date
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">19:02:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Question:</span>  Have we stated a cut off date for when one has to be a member in order to vote?
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">19:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well the first date is for that
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">19:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and announcements that require immediate actions are always better
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">19:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   traditionally, all applications have to be completed *before* the start of elections.  So techically I guess the cutoff date is 1 minute before elections  :-D
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">19:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  I am with henne on that
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">19:03:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">19:03:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So my qustion is has the membership team been consulted to ensure they can meet that deadline?
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">19:04:00 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">gets out the ouzu</span>
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">19:04:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we said that we will make a series of articles to promote the elections so more people  will vote
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">19:04:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the wiki page implies that people have to apply for membership within 4 weeks of Oct 28 in order to be able to vote
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">19:05:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh?
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">19:05:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's not good
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">19:05:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> warlordfff - would you please add date for membership application
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">19:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">19:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the election is typically our "membeship drive" as well.  If we're cutting people off on membership before Oct 28th, that's opposite of what we have done in the past
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">19:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is 28/10
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">19:06:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyone can aply earlier
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">19:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyone can apply anytime for member
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">19:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 28/10 = 2.8
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">19:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   so no one who applies in November can vote in December?
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">19:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> warlordfff - 28/10 + 4 weeks = Novmber 25th?
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">19:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> appears to me the date depends on how quickly these things can be processed, not sure the election committee has much influence on that process
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">19:06:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span>  yes
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">19:07:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> robjo - not the process date; the last date someone can apply for membership and be eligle to vote
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">19:07:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d1g1tltom&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it's the same procedure as always, people have 4 weeks to apply for membership
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">19:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> brb
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">19:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d1g1tltom&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> until 25.11.
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">19:07:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> d1g1tltom,   yes but what robjo  is saying and what warlordfff subsequently nodded to is that you have to apply before oct 28.
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">19:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap we only change the dates
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">19:08:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> noooooooo
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">19:08:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or rather what robjo is saying is that the language imiplies you have to apply before Oct 28
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">19:08:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> read the sceduale
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> That's what I said, if I apply on Oct 29 and my application isn't processed in time it doesn't matter
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">19:08:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d1g1tltom&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the earlier they apply the higher the chance is the the membership team can look at them
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">19:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> oh you know what we mean man
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">19:08:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> it all depends on how fast membership applications can be processed.
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">19:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">19:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the people that process the applications need to set the cut off date
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">19:09:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I ask again (question was not answered earlier)  has the membership team been consulted on this?
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">19:09:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but I don't think this would be a problem
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">19:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">19:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> they have not
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">19:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> robjo - good point - do we have  a member of the membership team at this meeting that can respond to this question?
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait people please
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">19:10:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you need to consult with them.   It is not respectful to impose a date on them without their opportunity to provide feedback
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">19:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">19:10:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the distance between the dates is the same as the previous years
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">19:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the only we changed is the actual dates
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> in fact that is what we said in the email invitation to you to join the election team, that you need to communicate with the membership team.
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">19:10:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> do not assume, ask them please
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Please contact them promptly and make sure it is okay before assuming.
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> The membership team has expressed in the past that they do not like being told what to do.   We need to respect their territory.
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok, I will talk to the others and anyway after the meeting i will send the e-mail

<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes?
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:13:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we did not change the distance between the dates, so why this year you assume it will be a problem?
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:13:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   no  you misread.  I didn't object to distance
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> do you know that it was not a problem for the last eleaction?
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I was merely focusing on what robjo said was the textual impression of cutoff dates for membership.  But that's now clarified.  And not an issue

<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">19:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> yes, all we are asking is that someone from the election committee ask the membership committee how much time they need to process apps prior to election date.
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">19:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">19:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> warlordfff - a suggestion for the election wiki page.  Would you add a sentence explaining where a list of "approved" candidates will be maintained.
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">19:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what i once again assume was the following

<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">19:16:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have Thomas in the group that was also in the previous election committees ,so that is why

<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">19:16:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   Exactly.   Scheduling in the past has often been influenced by membership team's ability to meet the deadlines.

<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">19:23:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think the very specific question we need to address is "Do we promote derivates"?
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">19:23:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Right now http://software.opensuse.org points to http://en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">19:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure we do. we ask for people to create them and put a lot of effort into it
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">19:23:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> The bento theme has a menu with (under "Community") a link to the openSUSE shop
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">19:23:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so yes we promote derivatives
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">19:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Fair enough.  And then the next quesitoni s how do we wwant to promote them?   On the same page with openSUSE stuff or separately?
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">19:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> can we let AJ finish first
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">19:25:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">19:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Or asked differently: Do we promote some stuff more than others?
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">19:25:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes AJaeger  that's a better frame of the question
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">19:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Right now we only promote the openSUSE box by open-slx and the openSUSE shop - nothing else.

<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">19:27:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so OSP is the one and only official reseller
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">19:27:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">19:27:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> Write a better proposal and I'm happy to support it ;)
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">19:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,  rephrase...  they are not exclusive.  They just happen to be the only one doing it
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">19:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but there are smaller shops taht are doing local  "el-cheapo" burns for distribution as well.
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">19:28:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> OSP is the only box offering without modifications
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">19:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">19:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Yeah, and my policies did not mention those.
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">19:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats why we should promote it
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">19:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">19:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> as sidenote, no need to promote Old Toad as I don't think there is an official offering currently
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">19:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but if we would have more boxes...
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">19:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, this is not a complete policy, just a start ;)
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">19:29:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   right now no.  But it is an example and we're trying to be all inclusive of possibile scenarios so we don't have to re-discuss this every year  :-)
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">19:29:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> proposal sounds reasonable to me
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">19:29:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so the policy should be: promote all boxes with unmodified versions that asked for trademark permissions
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">19:29:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">19:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that's a place where we can draw a line
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">19:30:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   proposal sounds good to me as well, but it does not resolve the question of what degree of emphasis we want to give to derivates as well as local cheap-burn shops (which did not get mentioend in the proposal)
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">19:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> Yes, that's item 2.
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">19:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> the rest is not in need of any policy
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">19:31:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well a second page that lists all the other options sounds fine with me, and practical
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">19:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the rest is a question on what whoever maintains software
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">19:31:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or the wiki pages decides
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">19:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   I'm thinking that as well
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">19:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> we do have the category of "Based on openSUSE"  Those are within the trademark guidelines.  If they have recieved board approval for use of the trademark why shouldn't we include those?

<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">19:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> because we only promote unmodified versions

<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">19:31:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   doesn't that contradict what you said earlier?

<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">19:33:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> one is the answer to the question what we promote by default
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">19:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the other one is an answer to if we want to promote something or not
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">19:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so  here's what we do...   The official offerings (which are unmodified) are on the official promotion page,  and the unofficial offerings which are modified go on a second page  (provided they ask us properly to put it there)
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">19:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Right?
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">19:34:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> sounds good to me
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">19:34:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the "policy" doenst need to cover the unofficial offerings
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">19:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I don't think the policy needs to cover every corner case, yes agreed with henne
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">19:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no... the policy is essentially "you get listed as an unofficial offering if you ask nicely"  :-)
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">19:35:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or if you add yourself to the wiki page

<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">19:35:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the only question is what we put on /Buy_openSUSE

<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">19:36:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> because we have to draw the line somewhere

Formal official boxed version from someone like OSP... and small burn shop in some remote location that doesn't necessarily fancy it up but just makes cheap burns for those who can't get internet downloads.   They go on the page too?
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">19:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> that's what it says "Buy_openSUSE", a derivative is not openSUSE

<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">19:37:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats why I would specifically mention "boxes" in that policy

<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">19:40:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> box on main page, everything else on another one that's linked from there, how about that?
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">19:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   i think you are creating the problem.  I'm sorry.    If "unmodified" is the only rule, then that tiny shop in India can demand to have equal promotion to OSP.
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">19:40:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> -1
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">19:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">19:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and frankly I don't think that's fair to OSP which puts a lot of money into designing a commercially sale-able product
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">19:41:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if they produce an unmodified version that fits into our definition of box
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">19:41:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> why wouldnt we promote them
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">19:41:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> especially as OSP wont sell in india
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">19:41:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> How do you know?
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">19:41:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> let them send one?
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">19:41:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> why not?
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">19:41:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I mean, this is going nowhere
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">19:41:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or how do I know that OSP doesnt sell in india?
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">19:41:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If OSP wouldn't make money they wouldn't do it, thus lets not worry about how much money they spend
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">19:42:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> IMHO anything that is unmodified falls into the "Buy_openSUSE" category
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">19:43:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we have to be careful not to give exclusivity or even the appearance of exclusivity.  But at the same time, we don't want to discourage such ventures either.
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">19:43:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anything that is unmodified and resembles the old boxes
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">19:43:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whats the problem with that?
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">19:43:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> thus someone selling a $1 DVD of an unmodified iso image falls in the "Buy_openSUSE" category

<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">19:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we can however draw the line at the trademark, everyone having unmodified and applied for trademark goes on "Buy_openSUSE"

<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">19:44:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so why isn't that copmany with the USB Stick offering (I forget the name) not going to get equal display here?

<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">19:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Why does it have to resemble the box?

<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">19:50:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I simply believe that if its an umodified version, and its a quality product, then (provided a request was made) we promote it just the same.  I see NO reason at all why we cano't offer choices on that page that you can buy either a box or a usb stick (of equal quality)  instead of making our folks jump around page after page
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">19:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   exaclty.  Why are we hung up on "box" in this day and age.
<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">19:51:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> because we always had it and people love it

<a name="l-654"></a><span class="tm">19:56:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> How many "cheepo" resellers do we have that have applied for trademark usage?
<a name="l-655"></a><span class="tm">19:57:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   just a handful.  But I think by saying "commercially-packaged" that effectively eliminates the cheepos
<a name="l-656"></a><span class="tm">19:57:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so what is commercially-packaged?
<a name="l-657"></a><span class="tm">19:58:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Again, a DVD in a DVD box, like a box you get a movie in when you buy it from a store, is commercially packaged
<a name="l-658"></a><span class="tm">19:58:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Something you would buy off a shelf in an electronics store and not something you'd buy off a vendor on the street corner  :-)
<a name="l-659"></a><span class="tm">19:58:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> suseROCKs, henne: Looking at your proposals, you would create today exactly the same webpage, wouldn't you?
<a name="l-660"></a><span class="tm">19:59:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then it is the same proposal
<a name="l-661"></a><span class="tm">19:59:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   my proposal basically does not exclude a commercially-provided USB stick.
<a name="l-662"></a><span class="tm">19:59:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> My point is that we should not cut out the little guy who does not have a boat load of cash to spend upfront to produce a box
<a name="l-663"></a><span class="tm">19:59:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> we don't we just dont put him in the front row
<a name="l-664"></a><span class="tm">19:59:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   Then we're diverging on different paths here
<a name="l-665"></a><span class="tm">20:00:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I wouldn't put him in the front row either.  Its not fair to the guy like OSP who spends oodles of cash only to be usupred by a dollar vendor
<a name="l-666"></a><span class="tm">20:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> So, create a second page linked from thefirst for all these
<a name="l-667"></a><span class="tm">20:00:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I also don't think its fair for the guy who spends oodles of cash to create a USB offering to simply not be qualified because it isn't a DVD.   That is arbitrary
<a name="l-668"></a><span class="tm">20:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok guys - hold on....
<a name="l-669"></a><span class="tm">20:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> for me a commercially packaged usb stick with opensuse on it resembles the box
<a name="l-670"></a><span class="tm">20:01:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> We have 2 proposals.  Does someone want to propose a 3rd?
<a name="l-671"></a><span class="tm">20:01:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we actually have only one proposal it seems
<a name="l-672"></a><span class="tm">20:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   then why were you disagreeing earlier when I said the USB guy should be on that page?
<a name="l-673"></a><span class="tm">20:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> seems we went roundabout for no reason here
<a name="l-674"></a><span class="tm">20:02:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that usb guy didn't ask yet
<a name="l-675"></a><span class="tm">20:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I wasn't referring to a *that*... I was referring to a policy that we can refer to later on when we *do* get asked  :-)
<a name="l-676"></a><span class="tm">20:03:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't want this insane disucssion re-occurring each time we get asked  :-)
<a name="l-677"></a><span class="tm">20:03:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> i didn't disagree
<a name="l-678"></a><span class="tm">20:03:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so then voting is moot now  :-)
<a name="l-679"></a><span class="tm">20:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> right, AlanClark?
<a name="l-680"></a><span class="tm">20:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Alright let's see if we can close this out.  All those in favor of the wording of proposition 2 say 'aye'
<a name="l-681"></a><span class="tm">20:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> All those against say 'nay'
<a name="l-682"></a><span class="tm">20:05:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we could even combine those
<a name="l-683"></a><span class="tm">20:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> henne - go for it as proposition 3
<a name="l-684"></a><span class="tm">20:05:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> proposal 3: We put on /Buy_openSUSE all box-like (commercial packaged) products that have asked for trademark approval and are unmodified versions of the openSUSE release
<a name="l-685"></a><span class="tm">20:06:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I like #3
<a name="l-686"></a><span class="tm">20:06:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but this is only wording. the spirit is what counts

<a name="l-697"></a><span class="tm">20:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> AJ you had another item
<a name="l-698"></a><span class="tm">20:10:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yay!!!
<a name="l-699"></a><span class="tm">20:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> yeah - what are we doing with others?
<a name="l-700"></a><span class="tm">20:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'd like to raise one as well
<a name="l-701"></a><span class="tm">20:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark, ?
<a name="l-702"></a><span class="tm">20:11:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> will we have a second page linked from the first with other offerigns - or just ignore everything else?
<a name="l-703"></a><span class="tm">20:11:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can we leave that one to whomeever implements it?
<a name="l-704"></a><span class="tm">20:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   I think we should have a page that lists everything.  its nice courtesy and informational.  But should it be linked?  That's a bigger question
<a name="l-705"></a><span class="tm">20:11:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't need to decide everything by policy are we? :)
<a name="l-706"></a><span class="tm">20:12:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> can we wait to hear AlanClark's issue?
<a name="l-707"></a><span class="tm">20:12:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> no, let's work AJ's question first
<a name="l-708"></a><span class="tm">20:12:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-709"></a><span class="tm">20:13:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we leave that one to whomeever implements the Buy_openSUSE and the other page?
<a name="l-710"></a><span class="tm">20:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> done
<a name="l-711"></a><span class="tm">20:13:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so AJaeger's quesiton is  twofold... 1)  Should we have another page listing everything?  I think yes.  Should we link from the main page?   I'm leery of that.
<a name="l-712"></a><span class="tm">20:13:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yeah, you can delegate that...
<a name="l-713"></a><span class="tm">20:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   there are ramifications.
<a name="l-714"></a><span class="tm">20:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm also leery of a link - but without a link will anyone ever find it?
<a name="l-715"></a><span class="tm">20:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> As for the delegation, AJaeger and I did talk earlier and I susggested this be the marketing team's task to implement it.
<a name="l-716"></a><span class="tm">20:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> no
<a name="l-717"></a><span class="tm">20:15:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  then again, did those who asked for permission ever ask to be found?  :-)
<a name="l-718"></a><span class="tm">20:15:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> henne, then there is no point to a second page
<a name="l-719"></a><span class="tm">20:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> you mean then there is no point to no link
<a name="l-720"></a><span class="tm">20:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> only Open Source Press asked for the main page AFAIR
<a name="l-721"></a><span class="tm">20:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,  correct.
<a name="l-722"></a><span class="tm">20:16:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I propose that we not do a second page at this time
<a name="l-723"></a><span class="tm">20:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">again:</span> why do we discuss this implementation detail here?
<a name="l-724"></a><span class="tm">20:16:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this was about policy
<a name="l-725"></a><span class="tm">20:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and a linkage sort of betrays that expecttion of promotion when we essentially are saying "but hey look over here for something possibly better"
<a name="l-726"></a><span class="tm">20:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   the policy is not about implementation,   The policy is about whether we should or should not create a situation in which we could potentially drive traffic away from those that get official promotion.
<a name="l-727"></a><span class="tm">20:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> thus betraying trust and potentially a revenue stream for us in future foundation when we broker deals to receive percentages.
<a name="l-728"></a><span class="tm">20:18:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> by adding a link to a wiki page?
<a name="l-729"></a><span class="tm">20:18:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> now tell me again you don't create problems where there arent any...
<a name="l-730"></a><span class="tm">20:19:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   we're already seeing OSP wanting to ensure they don't have too much competition (and its not really our domain to encourage/discourage competition) but there is a basic assumption that if you are on the main page, we don't drive traffic away from you.
<a name="l-731"></a><span class="tm">20:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it is a matter of trust in a relationship  and that's essentially what we're talkinga bout here
<a name="l-732"></a><span class="tm">20:20:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well we already discussed the issue of competition and agreed that we want it right?
<a name="l-733"></a><span class="tm">20:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't want something exclusive
<a name="l-734"></a><span class="tm">20:20:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then by that definition, we *do* want links.  Right?
<a name="l-735"></a><span class="tm">20:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> To move us forward I see  3 proposals: 1 - no second page, 2 - a second page with other offerings no link 3 - a second page with link to Buy_openSUSE page
<a name="l-736"></a><span class="tm">20:21:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes AlanClark
<a name="l-737"></a><span class="tm">20:21:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> does it really matter? As agreed upon, the "spirit" of the policy still only allows the "who we like" people to be promoted. Someone with a $1 DVD in a commercially packaged DVDV box is not going to make the cut anyway, even though this would meet the letter of the policy. So move on.
<a name="l-738"></a><span class="tm">20:22:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> where is that "who we like" part?
<a name="l-739"></a><span class="tm">20:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Apparently from the discussion we like the guys who make the current box and we try to protect their turf
<a name="l-740"></a><span class="tm">20:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats not the case
<a name="l-741"></a><span class="tm">20:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> sorry that's what it sounds like to me.
<a name="l-742"></a><span class="tm">20:23:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we like them. we like competition. we like derivatives.
<a name="l-743"></a><span class="tm">20:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so far we found some clear policy and now we discuss about something small as a link on a wiki page...
<a name="l-744"></a><span class="tm">20:24:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> The larger question is - do we continue with the current state and only have that Buy_openSUSE page or will we have a second page?
<a name="l-745"></a><span class="tm">20:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its clear from what we agreed upon on this matter now
<a name="l-746"></a><span class="tm">20:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that we want a second page and that we want a link
<a name="l-747"></a><span class="tm">20:25:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> That's for me the main question - and then we can figure out how people find it.
<a name="l-748"></a><span class="tm">20:25:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 AJaeger
<a name="l-749"></a><span class="tm">20:25:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If  "we like competition. we like derivatives" then the link should not even be up for discussion, it should be there period, as a linked page will promote competition and derivatives ;)
<a name="l-750"></a><span class="tm">20:25:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> since when do we decide here if we want pages in the wiki or not?
<a name="l-751"></a><span class="tm">20:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> wtf?
<a name="l-752"></a><span class="tm">20:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> There are ramifications on both ends and it can affect future business dealings we have.  And why we are being shunned at looking at the picture in a forward-thinking way the way a board should behave is beyond me.
<a name="l-753"></a><span class="tm">20:26:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> just don't blow everything out of proportion and be done with it :)
<a name="l-754"></a><span class="tm">20:27:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,  but you're the one blowing things out of proporition.   We're just trying to define the proportions.
<a name="l-755"></a><span class="tm">20:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> Since those are commercial offerings. I'm fine with what you're saying now - but that wasn't clear to me from your earlier comments.
<a name="l-756"></a><span class="tm">20:27:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, it seems we're all on the same page here.

<a name="l-759"></a><span class="tm">20:27:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> My proposal: We mention other commercial offerings - and those that write the pages will set appropriate links.

<a name="l-818"></a><span class="tm">20:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The discussion at osc revolved around the number of mailing lists and IRC channels

<a name="l-820"></a><span class="tm">20:42:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so was there anything tangible?
<a name="l-821"></a><span class="tm">20:42:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> like which two lists or channels can we merge?
<a name="l-822"></a><span class="tm">20:42:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think for lists we can set a message limit as requirement
<a name="l-823"></a><span class="tm">20:42:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or something like that
<a name="l-824"></a><span class="tm">20:43:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-825"></a><span class="tm">20:43:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> message limit as requirement for what?
<a name="l-826"></a><span class="tm">20:43:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we try to make priorities about the wiki pages translation
<a name="l-827"></a><span class="tm">20:43:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'd like to mention that one of the topics i brought up in that session was trying to get boosters team more visible.  I'm glad to say that this mornign Dragotin and I discussed and he is going to try to get booster channel merged into project so that takes care of one area.
<a name="l-828"></a><span class="tm">20:43:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we=the Greeks
<a name="l-829"></a><span class="tm">20:43:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> anything that has less than 100 messages a month does not need a separate mailing list (3 messages a day)

<a name="l-831"></a><span class="tm">20:44:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> over which period of time and whats the alternative?
<a name="l-832"></a><span class="tm">20:44:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> trying to stick to one thing from the list. talk about the wiki next meeting when we hopefully have more time
<a name="l-833"></a><span class="tm">20:44:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> or Translation
<a name="l-834"></a><span class="tm">20:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think list combinations needs someone to sit down and actually examine all the lists and make a real proposal rather than a vague one we have right now.
<a name="l-835"></a><span class="tm">20:45:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 100 message per month then  you get your own list.
<a name="l-836"></a><span class="tm">20:45:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We all agree we'd like to see consolidation.  What we have had problems in the past is no one agrees what to consolidate yet.
<a name="l-837"></a><span class="tm">20:45:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> everything else goes into factory and gets prefixed with [....]
<a name="l-838"></a><span class="tm">20:45:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> huh?
<a name="l-839"></a><span class="tm">20:46:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you want mails on factory with the prefix [ham] discussing ham radio topics?
<a name="l-840"></a><span class="tm">20:46:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think that's a bit extreme
<a name="l-841"></a><span class="tm">20:46:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, so we have a cloud mailing list, that we shouldn't have started. This stuff should all go to factory with [cloud} as a prefix in the subject
<a name="l-842"></a><span class="tm">20:46:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Yes, the prefix cannot be enforced but will be part of the ettiquette
<a name="l-843"></a><span class="tm">20:47:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yes
<a name="l-844"></a><span class="tm">20:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> why extreme?
<a name="l-845"></a><span class="tm">20:47:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   Hmm  i think that's a bit difficult to achieve and I'm not sure its the right one.   It begs the question "Is the cloud mailing list unncessary or do not enough people know about it to discuss on it?"
<a name="l-846"></a><span class="tm">20:47:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> you do realize that you would scare off everybody that still cares for factory right? :)
<a name="l-847"></a><span class="tm">20:47:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and no I don't think that factory should be the automatic default for everything.
<a name="l-848"></a><span class="tm">20:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-849"></a><span class="tm">20:48:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, we can have some other collection bucket other than factory
<a name="l-850"></a><span class="tm">20:48:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we should look at lists that have overlaps and look at why they exist in the first place and why/whynot they're being utilized.   Then we can make sane consolidation proposals.
<a name="l-851"></a><span class="tm">20:48:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't really have those
<a name="l-852"></a><span class="tm">20:48:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am not trying to push factory, lets first decide if a message limit is appropriate
<a name="l-853"></a><span class="tm">20:48:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats why i ask for specific proposals
<a name="l-854"></a><span class="tm">20:49:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the cloud list for isntance was started to discuss the cloud topic
<a name="l-855"></a><span class="tm">20:49:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I feel we should appoint someone to take on the task of looking at everything closely to come up with a sane proposal for merges.
<a name="l-856"></a><span class="tm">20:49:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> absolutely decoupled from factory
<a name="l-857"></a><span class="tm">20:49:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or any other specific code stream
<a name="l-858"></a><span class="tm">20:49:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed and maybe cloud is a bad example
<a name="l-859"></a><span class="tm">20:50:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> with 3 msg per day only few local lists will remain
<a name="l-860"></a><span class="tm">20:50:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but there are surely other lists that should be combined   Let's let someone actually "taskforce" this to come up with a specific proposal
<a name="l-861"></a><span class="tm">20:50:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but that's how we end up with "a million" lists. Every topic gets their own list. Now no one can find anything
<a name="l-862"></a><span class="tm">20:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> -1 robjo
<a name="l-863"></a><span class="tm">20:50:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if you are interesting on cloud you go to cloud list archives
<a name="l-864"></a><span class="tm">20:51:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   yes but again that means we need someone to look at everything case by case and see if it is/isn't necessary.
<a name="l-865"></a><span class="tm">20:51:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> "no one finds anything" what do you mean by that?
<a name="l-866"></a><span class="tm">20:51:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> merging two low-traffic lists (with "compatible" topic) is easier than merging a low-traffic list into a high-traffic list
<a name="l-867"></a><span class="tm">20:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I move we appoint someone to review everything and make a proposal specific.
<a name="l-868"></a><span class="tm">20:51:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if that goess to factory you have a problem on searching this
<a name="l-869"></a><span class="tm">20:51:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> (imagine you are interested in the low-traffic topic - you have to delete 100 mails to get 3 mails that are interesting for you)
<a name="l-870"></a><span class="tm">20:52:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'll also offer a merge proposal - opensuse-wiki and opensuse-web could be merged IMHO
<a name="l-871"></a><span class="tm">20:52:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,  true.  But at the same time, are these lists low-traffic because we have so many that no one knows these lists exist?      The bigger question is how do we ensure we foster maximum communication on any given topic?
<a name="l-872"></a><span class="tm">20:53:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Guys, we have 8 minutes left to talk and decide something here
<a name="l-873"></a><span class="tm">20:53:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 7 now
<a name="l-874"></a><span class="tm">20:53:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how can one not know a list?
<a name="l-875"></a><span class="tm">20:53:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they are all listed

<a name="l-877"></a><span class="tm">20:53:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I doubt there will be a decision
<a name="l-878"></a><span class="tm">20:53:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a decision on what? :)
<a name="l-879"></a><span class="tm">20:53:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   You tell me.   I hear constantly people saying "I didn't know this list existed"

<a name="l-881"></a><span class="tm">20:53:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, then just leave it.
<a name="l-882"></a><span class="tm">20:54:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> let's merge lists that have the same topic

<a name="l-884"></a><span class="tm">20:54:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,  and I feel the only reason there isn't "the answer" (TM) is simply because we haven't assigned someone to look at it comprehensively in depth.  We're all speaking conjecture here
<a name="l-885"></a><span class="tm">20:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If we think the number of lists is just fine and the description we have is sufficient for people to find what they are looking for then we are OK.
