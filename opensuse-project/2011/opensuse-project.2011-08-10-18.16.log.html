<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> What is Contributor gifts?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:18:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> a present to people that contribute to openSUSE
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Am i allowed to just ask questions like this? or should i keep quite?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:18:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> (in various ways - development, bugreports, marketing, ...)
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> yes, questions are of course allowed ;-)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I hope everybody has read http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Contributor_gifts
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:19:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> wiki link?
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:19:33 </span><span class="nka">* cboltz</span> <span class="ac">was faster *eg*</span>
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:19:36 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">has</span>
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> I have contributed to this OpenSuse meeting, do i get a present?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> No i havnt read, will  do now
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> cboltz, yes. Thanks for creating the list
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah thanks
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:20:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Goku283:</span> that's one of the questions - who should receive a gift
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but how do you plan to go forward from here?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> the answer probably depends on which type of gift we choose
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:20:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Wheres the funding come from ?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> for example a "contributors" file on the FTP server doesn't have a real limit, but sending something physical has
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:21:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Goku283:</span> there's some sponsoring from SUSE - at least there was in the past, and I hope there will be again ;-)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:21:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so  virtual vs. physical
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:21:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> virtual?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this was never really the scope imho :)
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so cboltz  should focus directly on physical options?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:22:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't know
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:22:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> virtual opens another can of worms :)
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the goal is to choose a gift and to choose a method of choosing contributors that receive one :)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:22:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> The idea of giving someone a certificate of appreciation and an official letter is good
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'd indeed prefer the physical options
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> They can add it to their accomplishments and porfessional CV
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> my basic idea is to have something special/exclusive for contributors
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:23:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> and while I really honor the things we hand out at conferences, they don't fulfill this requirement
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> The hard part would be selecting the people and verifying there contributions?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:24:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> that basic idea was already in the task formulation ;)
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:24:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> as Alan wrote today: some people see it as a trophy
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> cboltz, from the list, which item do you feel fits the criteria best?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:25:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Trophies of your achievemnets is much better than an item which is won as a prize so to speak
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:25:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,   would it be possible to propose to have 2-3 things as sort of a catalog selection and allow someone who is to be awaded the chance to pick one item of their choosing?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:25:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> what about a quick copy&amp;paste round? Everybody chooses his favorite 3 ideas from the list and pastes them here ;-)
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so people order their trophy?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:25:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> e.g. I have no interest in getting a boxed edition.  but I might be interested in choosing the flashlight.    someone else would want the box
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:25:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sounds perverted....
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:26:19 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">shifts in his chair while sitting naked and says... what's perverted???</span>
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:26:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'd say the same item for everybody (but maybe something else for the next release)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:26:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> otherwise handling will be too difficult ;-)
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> the real question is: which item
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I feer the complexity of choosing items
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> come up with an item that is doable
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> that's why I proposed that everybody pastes his favorite 3 items here and now ;-)
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:27:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> come up with a method of choosing people that is doable
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there's never going to be an item that makes everyone satisfied
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:27:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes thats why cboltz has to choose one :)
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:28:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I literally toss my boxes into a corner and feel guilty that SUSE has spent so much money shipping it to me
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we already failed at a group decision 3 times
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> ok, then I choose "get your favorite bug fixed"
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:28:22 </span><span class="nka">* cboltz</span> <span class="ac">counts the bugs assigned to henne</span>
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:28:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no I'm proposing something different
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> openSUSE business cards (with the recipient name). Not very expensive, rewarding and useful for promoting openSUSE.  distinguished award to put on shelf/wall to show others what/something to put on   add a "thank you" letter
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:28:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> there the 3 i choose
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm proposing that we create a mechanism where cboltz chooses 3 items of equal value and when the recipient is notified can go to some web page and select the item they want
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:29:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> seems to me having to choose exactly one item to fit everything is what is dragging us down most
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:29:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> this is not lalalula land and I'm not your fairy ;)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:29:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> you said I should choose *eg*
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:29:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> I reckon the award, the thank you letter and the card,  then one choice of item from selectable list?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:29:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> i was counting on your intelligence...
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">seriously:</span> would the "get a bug fixed" idea work, or is this impossible to handle?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:30:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats impossible to handle because we don't control the people that can fix bugs
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I'll bite.  Whose fairy are you?
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:30:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yermoms
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:31:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> more or less - there are lots of assignees @suse.com which you can control
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nobody controls assignees with @suse.com
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:31:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,   I'm not sure we want to do that.   That umm..  puts a lot of pressure on things for what is simply a "thank you"
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> some companies here offer catalogues with items of similar value that can be used as presents
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:31:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if we go by membership as the gift recipients that's nearly 500 people
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> not even I ;)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:31:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> What is 2. Proposal from Manu Gupta on Google Code-In" ?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> simon123,   exactly what I'm thinking here
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Goku283:</span> thats the next topic. stay tuned
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Goku283,   wait until the topic has changed  :-)
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:32:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:32:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> i request a topic change....
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> The problem with multiple items is the staff required to work the list and ship the items
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> did you have a look at the do-ability of items on your list?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:32:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or is that brainstorming?
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:33:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> both ;-)
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> we can automate this with connect
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:33:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Are all the people invovled in OpenSuse doign this for free?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> that's why I added the "should be doable in 2 hours" to the bugfix idea for example
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> but some items are just brainstorming ;-)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Goku283:</span> how about you explore en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project for a while?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the item about free air trave to the yet-to-be-purchased openSUSE Island in the South Pacific is do-able
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> the bugfix thingee is simply not doable
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> especially if the contributor is a bugfixer him/herself  :-)
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so what do you think is the best doable thing from your list?
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:35:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> ok, then I'll move it to a "impossible ideas" section ;-)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:35:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> what do you think about the other ideas from the "things money can't buy" section?
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:36:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> I guess the easiest doable is the same as it is now:"Do nothing"
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:37:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> I know, but "do nothing" does not encourage contributors too much ;-)
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:37:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you know... cboltz hss done quite a bit of work here coming up with a list and rather than just unilaterally dieciding everything for himself, he's welcoming feedback on ideas
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:37:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> right
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and then he'll proceed further on the doability of the items
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> please do not insert this discouraging tone on him after all the work he put into this
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:38:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> i think the stuff coupled to a date (conference etc) is not really tangible
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> all cboltz is hearing right now is discouragement.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:38:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> if you are unlucky you have to wait 12 months for it
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> all cboltz is hearing now is that he should decicde :)
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> IIRC you didn't like my decision ;-)
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">18:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> have you decided?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">18:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> yes, I said I want to have a bug fixed
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">18:40:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> and then you probably checked your bug list for bugreports from me and hated the idea ;-)
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">18:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay then try to get that done
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">18:40:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> see you in 2034 :)

<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:40:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is an open source project
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there is no management

<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:42:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> this is simply not feasible and you know it
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:42:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> not sure I follow how you would implement this in the community
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:42:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> because you will have a nice time convincing yalokis manager to give him time

<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I understand the problem - that's why I said it could it could be handled similar to hackweek
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:44:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> can we ask henne's wife to come to next meeting so we can convince her?
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:44:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> how does hackweek work for people not employed by SUSE?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> it seems that we better forget bug fixing for now
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:45:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok seems this has totally devolved
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> known bug ;-)
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:45:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's step back a bit
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:45:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> agreed
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:45:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> so you release a decision with a bug. sounds not like you ;)
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:45:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,   this task was about finding a viable/affordable solution to distributing gifts to known contributors of openSUSE.  Let's not come up with solutions that require time on other people
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:46:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> delegation
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> something that is as close as "push-button-able" as possible
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and come up with a solution how to identify contributors
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Also it's about recognition more than reward
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:47:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> both are 90% done and just need a decision
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:47:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Public recognition
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:47:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> so we are more or less on the "things you can touch" list, right?
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:47:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i could decide: we send pins to all members
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I think selecting the people is the easier part of my proposal ;-)
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:48:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> Then it comes down to the organizational and time spent in carrying all of this out
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:48:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> creating the list of people manually is nearly impossible
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:48:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> therefore I'd propose:
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:48:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> We all already know what are good gifts and awards, some of you know already who deserves it, but how to do it?
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:49:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> * members - but they have to verify their postal address in connect. That would already filter out inactive members.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> delegate people to perform this?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> * add GSoC students and mentors
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:49:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Goku283&gt;</span> GSoC ?
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> * and add a way to manually add/propose someone who is not member (yet), but did a large contribution
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Goku283:</span> Google Summer of the Code

<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:52:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes. thats why we stopped this process too

<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">19:08:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And I move that the board takes a look at this closely and determines how to poke and encourage the Project to get involved in this
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">19:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I would not want to rest all the hard work on Manu as we did last timie for GSoC.   He has more than enough on his plate and has done fabulously well and we shouldn't expect him to always do all the work
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">19:09:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you propose the board is trying to find someone that does it?
