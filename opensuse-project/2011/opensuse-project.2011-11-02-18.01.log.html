<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:04:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   When you do #startmeeting you should make it meaningful  like @startmeeting Board+Project 11-02-2011 or something like that
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then when you do #topic, it appends to the meeting name you designated in #startmeeting
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I did that.?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:05:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> i missed that  :-)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:05:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so you didn't miss anything.

<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:07:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> Can we discuss contributor gifts first? I have to leave in about 15 minutes...
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> sure. cboltz go ahead with an update.  I've seen a lot of email, but am still catching.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> s/catching/catching up
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'll paste the summary...
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I sent a summary to the project ML about two weeks ago
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:09:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-10/msg00036.html
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> the (IMHO) most relevant replies were
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:09:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-10/msg00043.html
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:09:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-10/msg00041.html
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'll give a summary:
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> The most welcome gifts seem to be T-shirts (or polo shirts)
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> how come I don't see the contributor AI listed in the bugzila list?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:09:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> Most people think that "at each release" would be the best "frequency" for a gift - probably because they are used to it
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> The idea for playing cards resulted in the idea to create an openSUSE game (as a separate project), but not as a contributor gift
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:09:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> Also the idea of naming a star for each contributor came up, but that only means paying a random company for some cute paperwork.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> The idea of awards at the conference got mixed feedback
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:09:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> SLE* licenses (xx% off) were proposed as a general member benefit, but don't fit as a contributor gift
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:09:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> That's the summary - now discuss, decide and find a sponsor ;-)
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh wait I see it.  never mind  :-D
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span>  I know that you talked to AJ about the cost of world wide shipping
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:10:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> will a t-shirt bankrupt us?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> yes, that's why my last line includes "find a sponsor" ;-)
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wasn't the cost of tshirts one of the early reasons why we started this discussion?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm   a sponsor to pay for tshirt costs (incl. shipping?)
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> the problem is more located in the cost of shipment and customs and less in the costs for the tshirt if I understand AJ right
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> general question: how many people want such gifts?
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> (at least when it comes to the non-european countries)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:11:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span>  is correct. It's the cost of shipping
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">k-d-l:</span> well, not too many people actively ask for it
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:12:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> but they are very happy if they receive something as a "thank you"
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:12:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well... here's my perspective on tshirts.  When I started in the community I longed for a tshirt beecause I didn't have one...   Now.. a few years later, I literally have too many tshirts.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">k-d-l:</span> it's not about "want" I think, it's more about "you just get it if you contribute"
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> okay, maybe we should start a poll on connect first? Yeah. such thank yous are always nice, but at the same we have to find a sponsor.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:13:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And even been told by my GF, can't you wear something other than openSUSE?  :-D
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:13:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">k-d-l:</span> poll about what?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> what's your recommended next step?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> about delivering such gifts.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:13:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> take a shirt with tux on it tomorrow *g*
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> first we should decide if/what we want to do
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but the "how many" question is certainly valid.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:14:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> then someone[tm] can calculate the costs
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:14:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> How many shirts are we looking to send out?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:14:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I honestly don't think that a "sponsor" is the way to go  because the sponsor will expect their logo on the shirt as well.  And then we have to go through all kinds of design considerations, etc.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:14:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> and find out if it is possible
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the sponsor could even be SUSE
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> I would suggest to search a sponsor (what about SUSE?) and then create a budget first
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> AJ didn't promise anything, but also didn't say that it would be impossible
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:15:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,  well the sponsor right now is considered SUSE by default.  And SUSE indicates its costly
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">k-d-l:</span> that makes it difficult for us _and_ the sponsor because nobody knows how much money would be needed
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> here's my concern about the thread discussion so far.   It doesn't make clear that there is a biting cost factor associated with tshirts.     So people didn't really give "something other than a tshirt" enough thought.  That's why we haven't seen many cool alternative suggestions.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:16:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> anything we do is going to incur cost. Let's focus on what we really want to do, then we'll find a sponsor.
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> What are the proposed criteria to qualify for the gift?
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:17:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> yes, asking a sponsor "we need xxx � for yyy" (and risk to fail) is the way to go
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:17:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   You're a member.  That's the only criteria we use so far
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> agreed, anything physical will have shipping cost
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> works for me but then it should not be named a "contributor gift"
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:17:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we should start revoking membership status for those who don't vote in the elections two times then
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:18:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so we get rid of inactive members
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:18:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   But you don't become a member unless you're a contributor
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'm certain we have "inactive" members
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> although you can be a contributor without being a member.  True
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:18:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> any "manual" selection of people would cause lots of work and is probably impossible
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok - we have 3 subtopics here.  1 - decide if/what we want to do 2 - determine a  criteria 3- determine a sponsor.  I recommend that we have cboltz focus on the 1, then let's tackle the others
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> I agree, that's why I asked the question
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> What about the removal of board members for actions not becoming of the board?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:19:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span>  +1
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We should list it as a benefit (thus encouraging more people to apply for membership) that you'll get gifts with each release cycle.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> we already have a small additional requirement: enter or confirm your address in connect
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I hope this filters out inactive members
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> +1
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:19:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> good point
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok guys let's stay on task here so that we can keep the meeting on target.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> So, I will repeat. Members of the board, how will you enforce that for members of the board?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> the criteria was already decided some meetings ago (and is written to bugzilla) ;-)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:21:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> You will not get away with what you did, so you better answer!!!!!!
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:21:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> ok, good
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:21:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> Once again members of the board who do not listen, what will you do?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:21:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> The board answers to membership, what's your problem?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:22:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> please let us discuss the topic at hand.. its just being polite....
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:22:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> we can take this up in Q&amp;A afterwards
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Recently two members of the board made a decison without consenting the rest of the board
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> back to th etshirts, andvantage is that they are pretty light and should be easy to ship, i.e. pretty cheap
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> So, how do we deal with that?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:23:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> This is a seriuos issue
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> you are off topic
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> And o none of the members of the board have addressed it
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:23:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> maybe (I don't know the details), but it has nothing to do with contributor gifts ;-)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:23:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> please discuss it later in Q&amp;A

<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">18:25:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> the most welcome gift seem to be t-shirts (or polos if you want a better quality)
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">18:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> one of the reasons is that you can wear them at events etc.

<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:26:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> if its doable
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> +1 for the shirts
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:26:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> +1 for polo shirts.. also if the design is given I can ask local charges too ( might be cheap for us )
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> (which is different to the "normal" openSUSE t-shirts and the reason why I proposed to have something special from the beginning)
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:26:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap and all give sizes
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> yes, local production could help saving costs
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> You know,  tshirts can be shipped in little packaging like in tubes or vacuum squares.  Might make it even cheaper to send out
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> okay, so is there anything else to discuss than just how to get a sponsor to make them?
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:27:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:27:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> we could also try to find someone who distributes them in a country to save shipment costs
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:28:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> Locally it will take about 7 euro / tshirt with one or 2 colors and good quality I guess for like 30 tshits just for info in India
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> cboltz and others.  Those are good ideas tha we can chase offline.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:28:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's discuss logistics off-meeting.   We at least have a consensus on what we want to send out.
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:28:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> that sounds much cheaper than the shipment costs (and customs) :-)
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:28:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yep i think this discussion belongs to the mailing list
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> did you want to poll or go with a polo shirt recommendation?
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz:</span> yes, if we are OK with some delay, maybe we can stick shirts in people's suitcases when they travel to a given country
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:29:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> it looks like everyone here likes the idea, and a polo is better than a t-shirt
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:30:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">so:</span> yes, I recommend a polo shirt
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:30:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I only have one final suggestion on this topic.    Insted of polling tshirts vs. polo, let's open up a design poll and whatever is the best design that will influence whether it is a tshirt or polo
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> When I did some quick search for oSC shirts I found companies that do shirts for around $6
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:30:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> do you think there are designs that will only fit on a t-shirt _or_ a polo?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:31:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,   yes
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok let's go with a shirt. Let's work the details outside of this meeing.  cboltz would you setup a IRC or email thread so that we can work the details?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:31:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> A polo is more "logo-type" whereas a tshirt is more "anything goes"  :-)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:31:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> I'll send a mail to the project mailinglist
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> one last question: do we stay with "once per release" (which is what most people seem to prefer)?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:32:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> also please set up a wiki page where people can upload design proposals.
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> good idea
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,  +1 to per release
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:32:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> and we need a time line for submitting the proposals and final vote
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:32:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'd suggest breaking into several subtopics:  1. Shirt type (polo, t-shirt, ..) 2. design 3. how to distribute 4. sponsor(s)

<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> Hi yes..
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:37:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> First of all I must say thanks a lot to everyone in and out of meeting for making the list of tasks
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:38:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Some tasks are suited to GCI while some are not,, if No one minds them I had like to edit them this weekend
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:38:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span>  and prusnak are the admins again for GCi and results will be out by 9th Novemeber and yes we already submitted the applications
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:38:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> Please let students decide what is appropriate for them.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:38:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> no editing, IMHO
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:39:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Yes.. but the tasks vary from usually a few hours to days, but some are simply not
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> as they are from 13-17, however I will do anything with prior consent from the mentor who has added himself to the task
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Since its a no from you I wont touch it robjo
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> btw wikipage is at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GCI , list of tasks is at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GCI_tasks
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:40:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo, I don't think GCI works the same way as GSoC worked.   This one we have to assign tasks rather than let students propose tasks.   (esp. since these tasks are to be approved before the start of GCI)
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:41:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Does that sound good to everyone?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:41:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 manugupt1
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but if we assign, that would mean we have to have a "resume" from every student
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:42:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   No  we don't assign tasks to a specific person.  We assign (Define) tasks.  And students look at the list and grab what they can
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:42:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or am I wrong, manugupt1?
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:43:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I think the mentor has a choice in determining the student too
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Because at the end mentor decides if the student has completed the task or not
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well I guess that's something to be clarified on the mentor ML
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:44:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the mentor can pick or not the student, also he can reject a student
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:44:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> during the task
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> did that answer your question?
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that is what I asked and learned
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">18:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> any other questions for manugupt1?
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:45:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">spam:</span> the Greek Fedora community will work for openSUSE tasks here in Greece ;-)

<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> didn't really have a question, just pointed out that IMHO we should let students decide whether they feel capable of completing the task, rather than playing "god" and deciding for them what is suitable.

<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:47:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> We have a sizeable number of mentors but the more the better, and we lack code related tasks ( like bug triaging and code refactoring and other stuff ) so we need more of them
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">18:48:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> we have the cross links to "junior bugs" and I think we have "packaging" on the list, that ought to be sufficient

<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:49:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Thanks manugupt1anything else to discuss on this topic?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:49:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I dont think so..

<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:05:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I do have one question....
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:06:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> in last meeting, we all emphasized it was important to discuss with membership team regarding the election schedule.
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:06:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It's kind of moot now since the timeline is now publicly announced, but did the membership team ever get contacted?   Board never received any confirmation of this.
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes good question
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">19:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  Perhaps we should follow up with the membership committee to see if/what help they will need given the election deadlines.
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I just want to make sure they don't feel blindsided.   That's what they felt in the last round.
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">19:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes I remember the discussion.
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:10:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> That is a funny comment coming from you!!!

<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so we moved on further
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   you sent it to membership ML or?
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I send it to the list that is on the wiki
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> as contact
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then its a fair decision warlordfff
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I can find it and forward it to you if you like

<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">19:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I saw a proposal for tunisian openSUSE website.  I give +1 to that
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">19:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> The first is a request from the Tunisian Ambassadors for the creation of opensuse.tn
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">19:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> is not that legal?
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">19:17:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> they said they have a problem with the owner,am I right?
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">19:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> wasn´t that the guys in romania
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">19:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">19:18:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> no, it was romania, the second one
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">19:18:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> maybe I am wrong, sorry
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">19:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> +1 for opensuse.tn
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">19:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok I am wrong
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">19:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;k-d-l&gt;</span> +1 too
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">19:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> +1 opensuse.tn
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">19:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Do we have any of the Tunisian Ambassadors present?
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">19:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Tunisia just had an 80% election turnout.  Lets make sure they do 80+% for openSUSE elections too  :-)
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">19:21:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I would like to make the following proposal.
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">19:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Actually I have a question to the board before I make a proposal
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">19:23:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Actually my question isn't just to the board, but the members as well.
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">19:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> In the email, they stated that they would like to create the website with tutorials, articles, etc...
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">19:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Would we prefer that they do that on opensuse.tn or have opensuse.tn redirect to opensuse.org?
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">19:25:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> would be nice to have it redirected to the tunisian instance of our wiki (do have that?) but ultimately there are other things they could be doing on that website as well that wouldn't necessarily be redirected
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">19:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If they run opensuse.tn independently of .org then I am not in favor of this
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">19:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> why would opensuse.tn not be a redirect to .or with a parameter that shows localized pages?
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">19:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,  I guess it depends on what they're doing.    In general, I would encourage folks to redirect to a central place, yes
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">19:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I don't think we should "require" them, but rather offer them guidance.  They may not realize the capabilities here.
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">19:27:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> maybe then don't want to have just wiki
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">19:27:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> exactly  prusnak
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">19:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but i agree about guidance thingie
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">19:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> let's not limit them, but advise them we could offer them wiki space
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">19:28:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> eg
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">19:28:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but then we loose this at .org
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">19:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> tn.opensuse.org ?
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">19:28:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Do we have some written guidence that we can point them to?
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">19:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Maybe offer them a combination of both like have them redirected to wiki, but they can also like some article blog or something like that
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">19:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if they add tutorials and whatever that is completely independent from .org we loose info.
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">19:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  I don't think we have a very well coordinated FAQ on this kind of stuff.   (Could be wrong)    It's something we should strive for though, yes
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">19:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I can help them with that
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">19:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Having this stuff at .org might inspire others to translate the tutorials etc.
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">19:29:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> maybe after the elctions I could also write some related documentation
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">19:29:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> exactly.. and as it will mostly likely be in Arabic, it could be interesting for other Arabic readers
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">19:29:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> you are still expecting they are trying to start a wiki
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">19:29:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ah warlordfff:  you could really be a great guide for them.
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">19:29:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> which might not be true
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">19:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> no, I said tutorial
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">19:31:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there's also the concern that as we proliferate openSUSE sites, we disstort the openSUSE message across the board
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">19:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The audio portion of a video can be translated, or the video can be subtitled, whatever
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">19:31:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span>  I would be glad too, just tell them to get in touch with me
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">19:31:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">19:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but that's something we should address in some kind of task force to look at the overall symptoms and solutions rather than trying to figure it out here in a trademark topic discussion
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">19:31:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i think this is not for us to decide
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">19:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> just tell me they have a yes for registering a domain and they can consider redirecting it to tn.o.o
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">19:32:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I can give them great reasons to stay on the wiki and not make an independent site
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">19:32:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> because that's what's the best from the project perspective
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">19:32:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think this requires more discussion prior to a "trademark" vote
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">19:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> the trademark vote had happened
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">19:33:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   Not really,  we approve such domain requests in the past with the one caveat,  you don't shed openSUSE in a negative light.     We can't change the rules here for tunisia what we've already done for other countries
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">19:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> AlanClark and the others from the board tought me well on that
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">19:33:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> or not?
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">19:33:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   we voted  :-)
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">19:33:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> ah it was +1 from non-board member :-/
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">19:33:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> to warlordfff's point.  Novell, as the trademark owner, needs to purchase the domain.
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">19:34:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ok, was not aware of that
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">19:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> they can use it for re-direction
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">19:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> So here is my proposal for a board vote:
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">19:34:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 1. That  Alan work with legal to have them purchase the rights to the domain for 2 years
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">19:35:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> if it can be acquired for a "reasonable" amount of $$
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">19:35:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> umm  I think that's going to befuddle things
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">19:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i vote against that
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">19:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">19:36:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> has this happened before eg novell buying the domain ?
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">19:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> First of all, if that's the case, then Novell should just make life easier and buy all openSUSE.xx's out there and be done with it.
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">19:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> because by the time they'll have opensuse.tn they will go somewhere else
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">19:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and i disagree that novell needs to purchase the domain
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">19:37:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Prusnak:</span> +1 They don't by law have to
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">19:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Second, we want to encourage people to spread the word of openSUSE gospel.  If we add this layer of bureaucracy, then people won't feel as motivated to do some potentially creative things in their corner of the world
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">19:37:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree with prusnak and suseROCKs
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">19:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we can enforce the trademark if they do something bad on this site
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">19:37:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> Novell just needs to give them the rights to use the trademark, that is it
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">19:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but please let's not overdo this
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">19:38:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> It seems to me that Novell is trying to heavy hand the community here with misleading information!!!
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">19:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> please hold your horses
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">19:39:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> I am trying
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm surprised by your responses.  I was looking at it as an expense that the Amabassadors wouldn't have to cover.
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">19:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> A domain at 50 euro per year?
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:40:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I have no objection to buying the domains, but im concerned about adding delay and bureaucracy
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">19:40:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 23 per 2 years
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:40:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> same here
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">19:40:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> even better ;-)
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">19:40:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it's really easier to buy that themselves
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">19:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Its actually an ambassador benefit warlordfff ;)
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">19:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> you can use it
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:41:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> from my view
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:41:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But it should be done quickly imo..
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:41:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span>  yeap
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:41:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok so that leaves the approval of the trademark usage.
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:41:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I just don't think Novell buy the domain is within the spirit of the trademark guidelines we implemented
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> However... I think it is a nice gesture on Novell (or SUSE)'s part if they offer to reimburse your costs for purchasing a domain
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:42:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it will be much quicker to purchase it themselves +1 suseROCKs
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">19:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> SUSE has actually the legal right so...
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">19:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Reimbursement is a nice idea, once the site is functional for the ambassadors.. but thats a different topic I guess
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:43:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> especially because we're talking about a small amount and Novell doesn't like reimbursing amounts under 500 euro or so
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:43:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> local comunities can benefit alot by it
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">19:43:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> Ah.. I remember :)
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">19:43:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">19:43:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   so we encourage them to dummy up the reimbursement form  :-)
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">19:43:51 </span><span class="nka">* manugupt1</span> <span class="ac">wishes jospoortvliet makes a local account for the Indians</span>
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">19:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you suggest fraud? tssss...
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">19:44:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and i think we should replace Novell with SUSE in the sentences anyway, no?
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">19:44:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">19:44:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> with the approval of the trademark usage, do you want to propose anything additional?  redirection, work with warlordfff, etc?
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">19:44:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> hehe it's why a foundation would be good.

<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">19:59:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Basically focusing on the ML &amp; IRC topics at the moment.
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">19:59:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Received positive feedback to merging wiki &amp; web lists
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">19:59:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> That would be the first step.
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">20:00:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> feed back for merging cloud and virtualization was mixed.
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">20:01:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> One topic that came up was the naming. People appear to prefer not to start the list name with opensuse as we have opensuse-SOMETHING@opensuse.org
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">20:01:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  with a mixed response, do have a next step?
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">20:01:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We still need some kind of "hand to hand" combat for all lists and decide what could be merged and make more proposals
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">20:02:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> My proposal overall would be, evaluate what could/should be merged
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">20:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> then send a message to the effected lists with a proposal for merge and a new name.
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">20:03:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> set up a vote for those subscribed on the effected lists
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">20:03:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> sounds sensible to me
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">20:03:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> and does a majority win or does it need to be %100?

<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">20:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but not as it happened in this case
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">20:17:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> then we screwed up even more, because we were not able to communicate anything

I just told you how the board felt, according to what Alan and Bryen told me. And I said I thought it would make sense to hold off doing this until you would have build up trust in the community. Right now, you're exploding and not acting very professionally, which I think doesn't build up that trust.
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">20:18:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes there was I have an email stating that from Jos

<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">20:20:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so what i am saying is the we screwed up that we were not able to respond sooner with a decision
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">20:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> gregory and myself wanted to set up such a CC. We asked the board if they thought it was a good idea and if they would support it. Alan and Bryen said they thought the board wouldn't be comfortable with it considering gregory being so new. So I mailed gregory proposing to hold off from doing it for now.
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">20:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> So then what do you wan to do about it then?

<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">20:21:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> IMHO a community council would need to be voted on by membership, in which case I wonder what the difference to the board would be.
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">20:21:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but i guess we have to wait until the decision is made

<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I think we have two decisions to make: Will we have a CC - and how should be on it?
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:22:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> You are chastising people for voicing their opinion, not a good way to get a welcome response to your requests.
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:22:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> s/how/who/
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> the idea was to have a separate body for that, because you might want to resolve the conflicts inside of the board as well (for example)
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> no that's not the point
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">20:22:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I think we could start such a thing, the way gregory and myself wanted to do it, it would have no power and people would be free to come to it (or not). But of course it would be nice if the community and esp the board would support it. When they said they probably wouldn't, yet,  I proposed to hold off.
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">20:22:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and also it might be a good idea to have trained professionals in CC
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">20:22:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> there has been no response from the board in 6 weeks

<a name="l-637"></a><span class="tm">20:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> not opinion
<a name="l-638"></a><span class="tm">20:34:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> let me add something
<a name="l-639"></a><span class="tm">20:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> please you do not know all the details
<a name="l-640"></a><span class="tm">20:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> while there has been no official response, 2 board members told me at brainshare they felt that the board would probably not support this
<a name="l-641"></a><span class="tm">20:34:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> your tone of voice has nothing to do with the details
<a name="l-642"></a><span class="tm">20:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> because they felt that gmzysk is quite new and they felt not comfortable having him in such a sensitive position without knowing him or having the community know him
<a name="l-643"></a><span class="tm">20:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> further you will find that there is great respect for those on the board within the community, you are not making any frieds here at the moment.
<a name="l-644"></a><span class="tm">20:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oper4&gt;</span> sorry I was away, thank you for the information
<a name="l-645"></a><span class="tm">20:35:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I relayed this back to gregory, suggesting we should wait doing the CC until gregory had been around for a while longer.
<a name="l-646"></a><span class="tm">20:35:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Please you do not know all the details, so do not attack
<a name="l-647"></a><span class="tm">20:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> robjo we're attempting to givie the details but you two are interupting :D
<a name="l-648"></a><span class="tm">20:36:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and tbh i think the rest of the board which might have been supportive of this initiative in the beginning, won't support the proposal after the recent development
<a name="l-649"></a><span class="tm">20:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> please go ahead
<a name="l-650"></a><span class="tm">20:36:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> note that in my opinion the board doesn't HAVE to OK the CC but I am not comfortable doing it if the board thinks it is a bad idea.
<a name="l-651"></a><span class="tm">20:37:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> why is that?
<a name="l-652"></a><span class="tm">20:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> after my email, gregory send the board a mail which, well, wasn't very constructive in my opinion... The board still has not replied
<a name="l-653"></a><span class="tm">20:37:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> except for now, that is :D
<a name="l-654"></a><span class="tm">20:37:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I hope I gave a good overview, that's it mrdocs
<a name="l-655"></a><span class="tm">20:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> thanks
<a name="l-656"></a><span class="tm">20:37:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> It has been weeks also with no response: so no not very respectful either
<a name="l-657"></a><span class="tm">20:38:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> no its a problem the board itself needs to address
<a name="l-658"></a><span class="tm">20:38:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-659"></a><span class="tm">20:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> there's people outside waiting during months for becoming a member !
<a name="l-660"></a><span class="tm">20:39:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> pushing agressively, naturally makes one want to back up and say "What is going on ?"
<a name="l-661"></a><span class="tm">20:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oper4&gt;</span> any idea why #opensuse is invite only?
<a name="l-662"></a><span class="tm">20:39:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> which isn't acceptable either ..
<a name="l-663"></a><span class="tm">20:39:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oper4:</span> it isn't
<a name="l-664"></a><span class="tm">20:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oper4:</span> /join #suse
<a name="l-665"></a><span class="tm">20:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oper4:</span> use #suse
<a name="l-666"></a><span class="tm">20:39:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oper4&gt;</span> oh ok
<a name="l-667"></a><span class="tm">20:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> this has nothing to do with membership
<a name="l-668"></a><span class="tm">20:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> is that currently a problem ?
<a name="l-669"></a><span class="tm">20:39:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but it is not a board decision, whether or not there is a CC is a decision for membership and needs a discussion on -project the board can way in on that discussion
<a name="l-670"></a><span class="tm">20:40:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> well I think you can see why I am angry
<a name="l-671"></a><span class="tm">20:40:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am well aware that -project threads get out of hand at time
<a name="l-672"></a><span class="tm">20:40:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> nope just want to say to stressed people to take a breath, go outside make a walk, and come back after 12.1 release, and elections
<a name="l-673"></a><span class="tm">20:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> that all
<a name="l-674"></a><span class="tm">20:40:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> however, that's where the discussion belongs
<a name="l-675"></a><span class="tm">20:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Exactly
<a name="l-676"></a><span class="tm">20:40:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> I think tigerfoot wanted to point out that in openSUSE some things don't move as quickly as some people wish
<a name="l-677"></a><span class="tm">20:40:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> best thing said in the last half hour :)
<a name="l-678"></a><span class="tm">20:41:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> let me add one thing, btw: after gregory and myself send the proposal to the board for comments, we only got one positive response from pavol. Afer otherwise silent, we decided to move forward and get things up and running. This was stonewalled at the administrative level (setting up a ML) without any explanation. So let me be clear: the frustration from gregory is understandable to say the least.
<a name="l-679"></a><span class="tm">20:41:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> we *are* volunteers with family, job and other responsibilties
<a name="l-680"></a><span class="tm">20:41:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ajaeger:</span> that still does not mean that they cannot write an email saying we are working on it
<a name="l-681"></a><span class="tm">20:41:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I agree with jospoortvliet
<a name="l-682"></a><span class="tm">20:41:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span>  I respect you man but you are over reacting on that man
<a name="l-683"></a><span class="tm">20:41:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> one thing has to be said though: the way this was handled was terrible
<a name="l-684"></a><span class="tm">20:41:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> jospoortvliet yaloki : Thanks for the support
<a name="l-685"></a><span class="tm">20:41:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> to put it politely
<a name="l-686"></a><span class="tm">20:42:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> an that shouldn't go out of sight either
<a name="l-687"></a><span class="tm">20:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> s/an/and/
<a name="l-688"></a><span class="tm">20:42:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> As I understood the CC in the beginning I don't think that it needed board approval, but when someone starts asking for admistrative rights, then that raises questions to the board.
<a name="l-689"></a><span class="tm">20:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But why not on -project list thats a question??
<a name="l-690"></a><span class="tm">20:42:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 yaloki
<a name="l-691"></a><span class="tm">20:42:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> thanks man and I understand your angle
<a name="l-692"></a><span class="tm">20:42:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> no it has caused some reflection by board members
<a name="l-693"></a><span class="tm">20:42:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I sure hope so
<a name="l-694"></a><span class="tm">20:42:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I'm as guilty as the next to have way too many things to do
<a name="l-695"></a><span class="tm">20:42:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I have a question here, Can I ask
<a name="l-696"></a><span class="tm">20:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we do not need yet another ML
<a name="l-697"></a><span class="tm">20:43:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> please go ahead
<a name="l-698"></a><span class="tm">20:43:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and it's not reasonable to expect a response within 1 or 2 days in every case
<a name="l-699"></a><span class="tm">20:43:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but emails have remained unanswered for many weeks
<a name="l-700"></a><span class="tm">20:43:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> the admin rights were for a list, 1 ML
<a name="l-701"></a><span class="tm">20:43:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> Will you add to your campaign a "service-level-agreement" for emails? ;)
<a name="l-702"></a><span class="tm">20:43:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> and all the admins information
<a name="l-703"></a><span class="tm">20:43:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> The only question, is there are a fw people here and they feel it was done behind doors, and nothing on the project list so why not that
<a name="l-704"></a><span class="tm">20:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> no, but decency is not asking for too much I think
<a name="l-705"></a><span class="tm">20:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> because we simply wanted to know what the board thought about it, not what everybody else thought. If the board liked it, we had the support from ppl who have some good experience and we would decide to move forward with it. We don't have to ask anyone for permission anyway
<a name="l-706"></a><span class="tm">20:44:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> and we both know why it happened that way
<a name="l-707"></a><span class="tm">20:44:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> read the rest of the thread, I was not asking for details just who to contact
<a name="l-708"></a><span class="tm">20:44:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But isnt it a too big thing to let the board carry alone and not the members get involved
<a name="l-709"></a><span class="tm">20:44:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> asking the board wasn't necessarily the end of the story
<a name="l-710"></a><span class="tm">20:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> and, also, you don't need permission to start doing something
<a name="l-711"></a><span class="tm">20:45:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> it should be a private, closed ml. but could also be gregory and myself just mailing to each other and people contacting us privately. We just thought a ML, with archives, would be a better, more transparent way to handle things.
<a name="l-712"></a><span class="tm">20:45:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it needs legitimacy and trust, which is why I agree that it is very useful that it has backing from the board
<a name="l-713"></a><span class="tm">20:45:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> Why was not the proposal public that was my question
<a name="l-714"></a><span class="tm">20:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> it wasn't at that point
<a name="l-715"></a><span class="tm">20:45:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> may I say something?
<a name="l-716"></a><span class="tm">20:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> shoot :)
<a name="l-717"></a><span class="tm">20:45:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> please
<a name="l-718"></a><span class="tm">20:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> Thanks to the people that support me
<a name="l-719"></a><span class="tm">20:46:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> in order to avoid anothe Gnokii situation we made something that one year ago brought the project to a similar situation
<a name="l-720"></a><span class="tm">20:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> Rather than those that just want to make it all my fault
<a name="l-721"></a><span class="tm">20:46:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> that is a question only gregory and me can answer. And it is simple: we did not want to bikeshed. We just wanted to JUST DO IT(tm). If people wouldn't like it they could vote with their feet. But before we would go ahead we wanted at least the thoughts of a few key people. Some we spoke to, the board we asked via their mail address.
<a name="l-722"></a><span class="tm">20:46:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If you guys just wanted to get some feedback then mail to the board is of course just fine, however, you cannot show up here and start demanding apologies for people voicing their opinion and not getting a response
<a name="l-723"></a><span class="tm">20:46:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree with robjo here
<a name="l-724"></a><span class="tm">20:47:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> to me it sounded like a decision made by someone and forced upon
<a name="l-725"></a><span class="tm">20:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Several people have written the board asking that for me
<a name="l-726"></a><span class="tm">20:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> not at all

<a name="l-728"></a><span class="tm">20:47:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> I am still not clear what the council will do except for resolve conflicts

<a name="l-731"></a><span class="tm">20:48:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> wtf, it exist thousand of maillist possibility to start over the internet ...
<a name="l-732"></a><span class="tm">20:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> Yes the board should  have answered

<a name="l-735"></a><span class="tm">20:48:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> a lot of other things, with the next board
<a name="l-736"></a><span class="tm">20:48:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> start a private google group, and whatever you need to start, and start

<a name="l-776"></a><span class="tm">20:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok, we have several threads intermixed.  Let's see if we can bring this to a proposal for going forward.
<a name="l-777"></a><span class="tm">20:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> I don't think the proposed setup is a good idea anymore - seing the conversations today, if it creates so much discussion and agressiveness, then I don't want one at the moment.
<a name="l-778"></a><span class="tm">20:54:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> say "just do it" and then say that people must ask for permission on -project
<a name="l-779"></a><span class="tm">20:54:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> again it's not about decision making,  greg and me can decide to do this, if -project (or the board) agrees or not. But to know if it's a good idea I want input from people I trust, not from $random_person_ranting_on_-project
<a name="l-780"></a><span class="tm">20:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but that's yet another topic
<a name="l-781"></a><span class="tm">20:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> But this was bound to happen and if fixed will only get better

<a name="l-790"></a><span class="tm">20:56:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So can anyone draw up a summary
<a name="l-791"></a><span class="tm">20:56:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> We have no democracy, we have a meritocacy

<a name="l-795"></a><span class="tm">20:57:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> in a meritocracy (we don't have a democracy in openSUE) those who do the work should decide, not those who rant hardest, chasing everyone away, on the ML :D
<a name="l-796"></a><span class="tm">20:57:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> Yes.. but then all of them have not been included either

<a name="l-799"></a><span class="tm">20:58:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> also it could have been a separate Ml like for strategy

<a name="l-827"></a><span class="tm">21:03:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> the board suggests to wait with a CC until we know greg and greg knows us
<a name="l-828"></a><span class="tm">21:03:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that's also what I proposed to him earlier
<a name="l-829"></a><span class="tm">21:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> he seems to say no to that.
<a name="l-830"></a><span class="tm">21:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> no more to discuss, right?
<a name="l-831"></a><span class="tm">21:04:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> note that we could continue with the CC of course

<a name="l-834"></a><span class="tm">21:05:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> That would be a bad idea

<a name="l-836"></a><span class="tm">21:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but it's a two-man show and I'd rather not do that so I guess that's of the table too :D

<a name="l-856"></a><span class="tm">21:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span> You strike me as the person who thinks they should get commit privileges to a project because you submitted one patch, that's not how things work
<a name="l-857"></a><span class="tm">21:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> look, the CC was supposed to be started by Greg and myself. I think we can agree that right now it wouldn't serve much purpose to start it. So I'm out unless we can agree to wait at least 3-4 months. If at that point things look better, we do it. If not, we wait again :D
<a name="l-858"></a><span class="tm">21:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmzysk:</span>  manugupt1 reacted at what he saw and in what he saw he is right man, you cannot blame him for that

<a name="l-863"></a><span class="tm">21:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I have an opinion. from my perspective gmzysk has proposed a CC, suggesting the project needing such a body to help with conflicts. Then, because of perceptions about how the suggestion was handled, the situation has decended into one which, ironically, would benefit from the a CC.
<a name="l-864"></a><span class="tm">21:10:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> I am not saying the community is screwed. I am saying neglecting a group to handle these issue would screw the community by not giving it that support
<a name="l-865"></a><span class="tm">21:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> that's just not the way it works in some projects one has to contribute for years before getting commit access to the project repo
<a name="l-866"></a><span class="tm">21:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> not sure the analogy works here :)
<a name="l-867"></a><span class="tm">21:11:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> But do the people here are fit for the CC and the ones who are proposing it
<a name="l-868"></a><span class="tm">21:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmzysk&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> Spot on!
<a name="l-869"></a><span class="tm">21:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> its my opinion that the dispute does highlight a potential need for the CC, but the behaviour exhibited during this dispute suggests we either need more time to get to know greg (and visa versa)
<a name="l-870"></a><span class="tm">21:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I am not considering jospoortvliet here

<a name="l-874"></a><span class="tm">21:12:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> so my opinion would be strongly in agreement with jos..either wait, or I dont think its going to work with the current situation
