<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:13:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> and closing it as wontfix, well, isn't the best idea IMHO
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well come up with an idea
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that is workable

<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:14:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> on the marketing list that is :)
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:14:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that's the basic question: is there some money available for contributor gifts?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:14:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  I believe izabel was going to lead that discussion.  I can follow up with her on this.

<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cboltz,   well  right now, from what I can tell we are focusing a lot of current funds on the conference coming up.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> you know if there's an idea you always find money
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> With the Attachmate merger, that kind of put a lot of budgets all around in flux  so we kind of have to be patient a little longer
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> why do you think about funds first?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if you have the most awesome idea you find fuin
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:15:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> funds :)

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:41:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Shouldn't we have sent out an email to all openSUSE Members informing them of the vote?

<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> +1 and did we not have a bug/wishlist item to be able to mail all members ?
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> would be a nice idea, cause people can forget they have to vote before the 30 June
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:43:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  we actually forgot to send out an email in last election until I reminded someone (can't remember who) to do the mail blast to all members

<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:43:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Thomas sent at least one to project.
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:44:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   yeah but that doesn't ensure all members are reached.
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:44:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I don't know how to do it, if anyone does - I do think it's a good move.
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   does connect provide that mechanism?
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:44:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> 2 weeks until the deadline :D
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:44:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   any idea of the number of votes submitted so far?  (not what the votes were  but number of votes)
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:44:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> no it doesn't
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> connect is not a spambot
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:45:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> about 70

<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:45:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 70...  clearly we are not reaching out to our membership.  We have ~500 members now, right?
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">18:45:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">18:45:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> in a mass mailing format ?
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">18:46:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   how did we do it beefore when we sent out notices to members for elections?
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:47:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> -announce and -project should be enough
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">18:47:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   70 indicates it isn't
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">18:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> not all members follow mailing lists
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:47:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> if member is not following one of this, he/she probably is not going to vote when you send him an email
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">18:47:38 </span><span class="nka">* oldcpu</span> <span class="ac">notes it was announced also on the forums (but not all follow the forums either)</span>
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">18:47:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I disagree with that reasoning
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">18:47:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> what i am trying to say is that we have 70 active members
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">18:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and email blasting won't change that i guess
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:48:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,  and what I'm trying to say is we have 500 members and we should have a mechanism to directly reach them for membership-related events
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:48:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">18:48:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> prusnak I´m one of them cause I already voted
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">18:48:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> no a bit more, but reading mail, then strategy then voting can be disturbed at anytimes ... and then forget
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">18:48:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> what is mass mailing format?
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">18:49:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well here's my feeling then...  if we only get 70 votes.  then strategy fails even if 70 vote 100% for it.   We need to ensure as many votes as possible to show strong project-wide support for the strategy or it won't move forward
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">18:50:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i can show you how to extract the names/mail addresses from connect
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">18:50:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i can give you the plaintext with all addresses of members
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">18:50:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> so we can compose a mail &gt; push button &gt; send to all members
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">18:50:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> there is a button for that i implemented some time ago
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">18:50:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i am just hesitant to use it for spamming members
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">18:50:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> yes you can :)
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">18:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's fine if we have to do that,  but I'm curious still how we did it before.
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">18:50:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> where is the magic button then ? :)
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">18:51:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> because i don't think that's the way to go
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">18:51:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but i might be wrong
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">18:51:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   would you be willing to take on the action item (or pass it along to Thomas) to create a membership-direct mail reminder about voting?
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">18:51:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> sorry politely disagree... if im a member and hear nothing ever.. maybe no one cares about me ?
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">18:51:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> (i participated in all fedora board elections although I received NO email about that)

<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">18:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we did so for the board election
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">18:51:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I agree that pushing that button should be a very rare event. - votes are a case where all members need to be informed.

<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">18:56:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and Alan  :-)
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">18:56:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I wanted Chuck to give us an update on the 300 posts
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">18:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> he's not here
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">18:57:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> If Chuck is not here, let's move to the next topic
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">18:57:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 300
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">18:57:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> cool number
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">18:57:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and frankly I haven't seen any text anywhere that says If you post 300 posts, Facebook will not force you to migrate to Page and will keep Group open
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">18:57:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> that's what Chuck reported
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">18:57:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Everything Facebook tells me iss that if you're that large then you must shut down your group and go to Page
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">18:57:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i think that's going to change anyway
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">18:58:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's not argue that here
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">18:58:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> with Chuck not present
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">18:58:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so this "workaround" seems to be a contradiction to Facebook's stance.  But I dunno....
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">18:58:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  next topic then

<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">19:04:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> can we have some kind of roadmap which we can check and to see if we're on track or not at all?
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">19:04:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Talking with suseROCKS this morning, made me realize that we need to start to talk about $$ we will need to run the project next year.
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">19:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  that thing that grows on trees  :-)
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">19:05:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">19:06:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> $0
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">19:06:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> are you sure that foundation is about the money?
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">19:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> everything we gain is good
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">19:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> $0 makes it easy and hard
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">19:06:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   sure   But explaining why and how we intend to use money can lead to bigger gains  :-)
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">19:06:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> The money question -is about funding our Ambassadors travel, funding events like the conference, etc
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">19:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> maybe you should define what "run the project" means
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">19:07:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   that's a very broad question and really  subject to each area coming up with a dollar-figure justifying why they need what they need to do day-to-day activities
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">19:08:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> for example, funding for more hackfests
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">19:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well if you want a sum you need to itemize :)
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">19:08:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   precisely
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">19:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and that's why AlanClark  is saying we need to start thinkiga bout this stuff
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">19:09:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I've been thinking about it for marketing, but I certainly can't speak to other areas of the project
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">19:09:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but together as a board, we have a pretty decent global view of the Project and can identify all areas that need funds for speciic things and then prioritize them
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">19:09:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">19:09:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> we just need reasonable estimates in costs
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">19:09:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i would love to see foundation as a framework and inspiration to do cool stuff and have fun
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">19:10:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it's not all about just costs and funds
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">19:10:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">19:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,    isn't a hackfest fun?
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">19:10:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> however on the monies thing
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">19:10:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> because i'm starting to have a feeling we are trying to start a new company, not a foundation
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">19:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> aah never mind

<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">19:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,    the Foundation is about giving the openSUSE Community the ability to empower itself to control its direction.    Right now any and all funds are decided at the discretion of Company employees.
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> that's a bit enthusiastic but I do have a proposal there which I'll put forward soon
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">19:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;clint-&gt;</span> viewers will be able to see what I show them, from channels to seak support in, and overall discussion.. and topics yes
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">19:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And while jospoortvliet is doing an awesome job getting funds out to the community,  it would be nice if the community itself was able to manage and determine the priorities for those funds
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">19:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;clint-&gt;</span> &lt;(")
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">19:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> the point is not to discuss the $$ thing here, rather to raise the point that it needs to be worked on.  We will work on this over the next couple weeks on the Foundation mailing list.
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">19:12:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">clint-:</span> we're in the middle of a meeting. please

<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">19:32:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   Would you like to start off this topic?
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">19:33:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well I only know about the CfP and the sponsorship
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">19:33:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but I can fill you all in on that
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">19:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we've finished the sponsorship brochure and a few sponsors have been contacted
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">19:33:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> no commitments yet
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">19:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> go for it and we'll fill in on any other details
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">19:33:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and yes, we need to step that up. A recent idea is to contact our mirror network and SUSE/Novell partners
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">19:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> for them a cheaper sponsorship option is needed
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">19:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and we'll probably create a $500 'supporter' option
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">19:34:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I'll send a proposal to the team within a day and have already asked the openSUSE admins for a list of our mirror contacts
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">19:34:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> AlanClark has offered to work on the partner side
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">19:34:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> That's about monies
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">19:34:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then the CfP
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">19:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we have about 10 proposals
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">19:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that's not enough :D
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">19:35:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> We concluded that we might not be clear enough when it comes to requirements for the sessions
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">19:35:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> which is why I wrote the article about BoF's on news.o.o
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">19:35:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I believe I forgot to send a mail to -project and -factory about that so I will do so later today
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">19:35:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I'll be writing the Workshop article shortly

<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">19:35:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and I'm trying to find someone to write about a hack session
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">19:35:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   I think what we need to do on CFP team is to start specificying more WX sessions we want.
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">19:36:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and we'll keep pinging ppl on this
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">19:36:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We can definitely do that easily and come up with a good list of those types of events and then find the right people to lead them
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">19:36:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  you mean defining specific sessions and approaching people?

<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">19:48:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is there any way we can designate people outside of suse.de to help out?
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">19:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> any thoughts on how certain qualified members could be able to help ?
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">19:49:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> i point out an example (which isn't part of infrastructure itself).

<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">19:50:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if we could do that same concept for some of our infrastructure (e.g. build.o.o) this would help provide better 24/7 uptime for us
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">19:50:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yaloki is talking about the downtime of the build service

<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">19:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because of policies?
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">19:52:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes stuff like that

<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">19:52:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> understood.  but it also harms the community if we're relegated largely to NUE business hours.
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">19:53:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well this has nothing to do with community or not
<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">19:53:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> and thank god Adrian and darix are both interested and make an effort to be avaialble
<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">19:53:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 mrdocs
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">19:53:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> but they are single points of failure
<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">19:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but those guys deserve to have a life too  :-)
<a name="l-529"></a><span class="tm">19:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it's about a certain service level for the stuff
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">19:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">19:54:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and we can certainly not complain about that I think
<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">19:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,  service level.  Exactly
<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">19:54:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   why not?
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">19:54:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because I think its awesome :)
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">19:55:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have passionate people who care about this stuff
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">19:55:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> no.. we're not complaining, what we are saying is there very well might be capable interested people in the community to help make it better
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">19:55:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   you're not here on weekends when we see people bitching on a Friday night they can't do the work they wanted to do until Monday  :-)
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">19:55:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i very well understand the problem
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">19:55:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  no i agree the service level is awesome...
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">19:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and growing the community and recruiting new contributors only to find they can't do work the first time they try is kind of umm...  embarassing
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">19:56:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i'm not a sack of sand you know ;)
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">19:56:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> hehe henne we could never accuse you of that :)
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">19:56:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what I'm trying to say is this:
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">19:57:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,    Not accusing you of not getting it.  But I am saying it seems like you're saying there's no room for discussion nor for whom to discuss this with
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">19:57:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have this awesome deal with SUSE that we can host our shit there
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">19:57:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they pay people to take care of our shit
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">19:57:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and those people also do it with passion
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">19:57:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> even on the weekends
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">19:57:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> i agree there
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">19:58:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure, but why can't people who aren't paid but also have awesome passion help out?
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">19:58:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and this hoster says some stuff is off limits
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">19:58:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> isnt that something we can live with?
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">19:58:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> because you have to think about network security and everything
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">19:58:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   you tell me..   We want to increase our community and sometimes our community cannot work for days on end.
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">19:59:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I am thinking about all that...  but I don't think there isn't room to budge either.
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">19:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> e.g.   put openSUSE infrastructure on dedicated machines (vm or otherwise) where it won't affect the security of other services
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">20:00:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they _are_ in dedicated machines
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">20:00:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> all I'm asking here is that we try to look at the problem and see if there's some golden egg somewhere
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">20:00:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its not that simple :)
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">20:00:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> look
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you have to buy a powerswitch for 50.000 euros
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:00:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then you have logins to this
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> network security
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:00:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yadda yadda yaddaa
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:00:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I understand all that.  I'm not a sack of sand you know?  :-)
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">20:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its not always as simple as you think :)
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">20:01:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> All I'm saying is can we discuss and look at it   that's all
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">20:01:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">20:01:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we're doing this right now arent we?
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">20:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> not really
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">20:01:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you're basically saying there's no room for discussion
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">20:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes. in this specific case there isn't
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">20:02:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   let's at least discuss or identify areas where it is "safe"
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">20:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we already have
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">20:02:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> for example, no one thought to include a community member to moderate the -announce list.  Until I brought it up
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">20:03:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and we're its safe there are no problems with it
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">20:03:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I meant "safe" as in safe to include community members.  Not safe as in security
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">20:03:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> heh. no community member cared you mean....
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">20:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> there were external people in the moderators file before you even existed ;)
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">20:04:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes exactly
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">20:04:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's bull henne.  Sometimes people don't know they care until they're asked to care about a specific task.   People rise up to the ocassion very well when givein a very specific task
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">20:04:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I existed in 1968  :-P
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">20:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Fortunately I didn't exist as long as that old fart, mrdocs   :-)
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">20:05:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> really. we have so many hosts, services and everything that are maintained by community members
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">20:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Are you talking about external stuff or direct infrastructure stuff?
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">20:06:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If the latter, can you list?  Just for my curiousity
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">20:07:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i can't. i don't have access to community.opensuse.org
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">20:07:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but there is a lot of services on that machine for instance
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">20:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if not, I think we've beaten this topic to a pulp and we should move on to last topic
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">20:07:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there are also other hosts
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">20:08:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and often we "only" talk about deployment
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">20:08:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I still disagree with some of what you just said in the last few lines.  But we can agree to disagree  :-)     And just move on
<a name="l-593"></a><span class="tm">20:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you know? all the stuff is in a SCM and we just need to ping someone for deployment
<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">20:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> like with the wiki, news, lizards, etc. etc.

<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">20:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we're not going to move further on this discussion today so let's just move on to next topic

<a name="l-606"></a><span class="tm">20:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> I just seeing that more and more mirror are dropping openSUSE_Factory and home:
<a name="l-607"></a><span class="tm">20:12:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> i suspect the issue is disk/bandwidth

<a name="l-615"></a><span class="tm">20:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> can you list specific ones ?
<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">20:13:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,    how severe is this problem?
<a name="l-617"></a><span class="tm">20:14:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> can we add just an AI to watch and keep and eyes to have openSUSE especially openSUSE_Factory well spread around the world.
<a name="l-618"></a><span class="tm">20:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   who gets that AI and how do you watch for it?
<a name="l-619"></a><span class="tm">20:14:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And more importantly, how do you react to it after something comes up?
<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">20:15:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> this is something for opensuse-factory I think
<a name="l-621"></a><span class="tm">20:15:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> my ai proposal, is to find the right people (admin@o.o) able to talk with the right people on mirrors, and just get feedback and report here
<a name="l-622"></a><span class="tm">20:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Its a very good topic of concern, just...  we need a way to address it rather than just watch the fly float around the room
<a name="l-623"></a><span class="tm">20:15:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> admin@o.o. people are coolo and darix
<a name="l-624"></a><span class="tm">20:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I thought Lars handles mirrors?
<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">20:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> henne, just them ? also perharps adrianS for the obs synchro things ?
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">20:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> when darix has no time :)
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">20:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but none of them as time.
<a name="l-628"></a><span class="tm">20:16:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> just admin@o.o or opensuse-factory is fine
<a name="l-629"></a><span class="tm">20:16:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so perhaps tigerfoot can volutneer to assist them in monitoring and contacting mirror admins?
<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">20:17:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure. talk to them
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">20:17:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they know all the details
<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">20:17:15 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">ask my third clone if he can do that ?</span>
<a name="l-633"></a><span class="tm">20:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   at the very least... here's my suggestion.....
<a name="l-634"></a><span class="tm">20:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 1.  Talk to them.  Find out what's involved
<a name="l-635"></a><span class="tm">20:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> I've already send emails to supposed hostmaster, with just no answer ...
<a name="l-636"></a><span class="tm">20:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 2.  Decide if you want to help out or not
<a name="l-637"></a><span class="tm">20:18:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 3.  If you don't, summarize what you learned and post it somewhere inviting someone to volunteer to be this liaison person to the mirror community
<a name="l-638"></a><span class="tm">20:18:25 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">will send a mail, request for feedback on -factory</span>
<a name="l-639"></a><span class="tm">20:18:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   do you get the hostmaster info from the official list with openSUSE or somewhere else?
<a name="l-640"></a><span class="tm">20:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> please be specific :) with the mirror that dropped
<a name="l-641"></a><span class="tm">20:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> normal domain or hosts have to have a hostmaster@that-fucking-host.whatever
<a name="l-642"></a><span class="tm">20:19:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   ok  so it may not be the same contact addy as what Lars/Darix stores
<a name="l-643"></a><span class="tm">20:20:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> mirroradmin@ ?
<a name="l-644"></a><span class="tm">20:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> we usually have way more specific info

<a name="l-646"></a><span class="tm">20:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so that's a gap we can close.   Getting the info specific to tigerfoot so he can contact directly and properly
<a name="l-647"></a><span class="tm">20:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> no more openSUSE_Factory, and more everything that has factory KDF for example disappear weeks ago
<a name="l-648"></a><span class="tm">20:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   .de is the key.  You can't depend on those Germans!   :-)
<a name="l-649"></a><span class="tm">20:21:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so tigerfoot   you want to see this through and investigate how to improve the process?   (Say yes or no)
<a name="l-650"></a><span class="tm">20:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> thats carstens :)
