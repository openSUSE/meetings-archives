<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:04:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> do we still need to discuss something there?

<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:07:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we should have trademark discussion (which really is a variety of topics) as a topic on the agenda
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> trademark discussion?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes there's a variety, as I mentioned in the mailing list a few times lately
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> plus one more... Kim Groneman wants us to look into opensuse.us and decide if they are acting appropriately or not

<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes and some legitimate concerns out there about it too
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:10:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but let's put that under trademark topic and get the ball rolling on Topic #1
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't have a trademark topic
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> (yet)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's why I'm saying to add it  :-D
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:11:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and here i am. thinking we have a shorter meeting...

<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:16:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> A couple observations then a followup from the last board meeting
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Seems while some of us were taking holiday last week several persons outside of the openSUSE community took interest in  the ongoing conversations about the creation of a Foundation
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> We should point out that counter to what some are blogging this isn't a new topic that started 3 weeks ago.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Yes, and that's exactly the intention of the article I will be drafting up soon
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:19:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> The Foundation has been an initiative coming from the community, led by the openSUSE Board, dating back to early 2009 - perhaps earlier.  There have been lots of discussion on the channels, forums, ml, etc. There was even a presentation on this topic at the fall openSUSE conference.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think that it is also important for all to understand that  this isn't a 're-invent' effort.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Rather we are building on our already strong basis.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Documents such as the guiding principles, trademark policy, strategy document, election rules, ...
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:21:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (and credits for the initial idea and first bringing it up goes to Martin Lasarsch, a long time ago, by the way :))
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> What I would like is for all of you to respond to that mail with your bullet points of what you think needs to be emphasized.   I'll bring it all together into an article and then you all can confab about how the final write looks before we post.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:21:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> .While some new documents will need to be created, many of the discussions aren't about creating new policies but rather about updating the current policies to incorporate what has been learned over the past years.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:21:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I have comments thus far from AlanClark and yaloki.   rhorstkoetter  henne and prusnak   if you could add yours to the thread.  It will help a great deal.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:22:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it keeps slipping on my todo... :-/
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   You need to quit your dayjob.  It intereres with openSUSE too much.  :-)
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:22:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> what was the subject again?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I would very much appreciate if we could do that while I'm still on the board. The Foundation is a very important matter to me since a long time :)
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   I'd like that article posted in the next few days (or 1 week max) if possible, so you'll still be here
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> perfect :D
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:23:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   "Foundation Public Statement"
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:24:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> ah yes, still in my todo
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> too much shit is happening lately...
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:24:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and there was a time we complained not enough was happening  :-)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> What's that line?   Feast or Famine?
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> we suck at planning, putting election right after the holidays was not smart :)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:25:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> no, no, that's alright :D
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well. normaly we only would have had the elections...
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm actually glad we have stuff on our plate.   It shows we, the board, are really coming of age now
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:26:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> age or aged ;-)
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:26:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well afaik, I'm the oldest here, so let's stick with 'age"
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:26:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can we move on? :)
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:26:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> is 19:26 already...
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> alright...
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:26:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> any questions? ideas? feedback?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:27:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> With conversations happening in diverse places, two concerns have surfaced.  First that we are losing track of the information that has been discussed and second that we need to ensure that the process itself is as open and transparent as it can possibly be.  To address those concerns, a couple of action items were created at the last board meeting. First, to begin a series of wiki pages on the topic and second, to create a
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:27:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> mailing list for those interested in this topic.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:27:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what do we need to do for the wiki documentation stuff, and do we need to prepare anything in time for the new board?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> transition of information, etc.

<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it's a lot of content though

<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> remains to be seen whether we can write all that up before the next board comes into place
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:28:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what are you talking about?
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think can get it written down
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:29:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> or referenced
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:29:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can anyone please tell me what? :)

<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> will read backlog tmrw
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:32:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   i think its pretty hard to put it all on one page
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> is this a wiki page about the status of the foundation, or a wiki page describing the foundation and how it works?
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:32:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> vuntz,   it should be all of the above and then some  :-)
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:32:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> status, description, bylaws, todos, etc.
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:32:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> catching up with what we should have done much earlier already ;)
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:33:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> hmm, okay :-) It's good to have everything; but the "important" part for now would be tracking where we stand, I guess
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:33:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but you know how that goes, you start with something, too early and not enough to make a big fuzz about it, and then at some point you notice damn! we should have..
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:33:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> agreed, thats important, because I don't think we're all on the same page for example when it comes to "how it works"
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:34:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   within our community?  or what our community thinks vs what the media thinks?
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> everything else is also important, but right now, only a few people know the current status; which is why I think that's the most important point :-)
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:34:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> your point
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:34:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we should start with the current state, and then the history on how we came to that
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed vuntz   something we unintentionally forgot to make more visibly known  and we want to rectify that now
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so what do we want to have in the wiki?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the current draft of the bylaws?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or a link to the draft of the bylaws on a pad
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes plus more
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what more? :)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:36:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> for example I add to placeholders for Finance and Trademarks
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> historical data
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:36:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as yaloki pointed out
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we had many discussions with good results already, but there is no place where we noted summaries or conclusions, so we start kind of over and over again.
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what historical data?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:36:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   everything we've talked about since 2009.  :-)
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:36:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Look at what dragotin just said.  This is the problem with the perception of the foundation currently
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:36:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> agreed
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:36:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so links to all the board meeting minutes?
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:37:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what else is there?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I don't think that level of detail would be useful to anyone :)
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:37:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what about the discussions before the board meetings were public?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> basically what was in the presentation we gave at the conf
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:37:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> like when we were discussing using umbrella organizations like SPI.  Why did we decide we didn't want to go that route?  etc.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:37:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> what decisions we made and why
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> those where about the bylaws and would be the draft :)
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:38:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> SPI = bylaws?
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:38:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so is the presentation enough?
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:38:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Good start
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:38:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the discussions before the conference where about the bylaws

<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so I have

<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:39:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> * link to the board meeting minutes
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> * conference presentation
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:40:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> which is not enough
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> * finance
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:40:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> * trademarks
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:40:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> which I'm sure AlanClark will explain in a minute ;)
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:41:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what else if that is not enough?
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:41:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> links to board meeting minutes
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what about all the foundation discussions that happened before we went public with our meetings?   No link to that
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">19:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so there's a historical gap there that doesn't expalin some of the important discovery work we did before board meetings went public I think in end of 2009 or early 2010
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">19:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how do you want to get that data?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and meetbot didn't become active until May 2010, right?
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:43:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or do you want to manually collect all the nitty gritty details?
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">19:43:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> one of us will have to dig through old log records
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">19:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I think that what henne listed above should be enough
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">19:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the point isn't so much to have a public record
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> have fun ;)
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but to document the current state of things
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i agree with yaloki
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:43:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and why certain decisions were made
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:43:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> if people ask specific questions, then you'll be able to answer them, and add that to the wiki
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:43:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> lets not overdoo this...
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:43:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> well, isn't it about creating a good overview what happend so far rather than digging in old records?
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:44:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> +1
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:44:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:44:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and than start from now filling important things into the wiki
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:44:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> if/when more questions arise, we can add a Q&amp;A section :)
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:44:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well obviously we would summarize what was in old records.  I'm not saying we have to post logs of every meeting
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">19:44:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> okay
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:44:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I'm saying if we don't even bother to provide summaries of relevant work done, we're missing historical picture.  That's all
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:44:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so finally the wiki will be a documentation of what happened on the way to the foundation
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> anything more to discuss on this topic ?
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:44:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   yes
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:45:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Just to turn to the trademark discussion
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:45:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> wait please
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what is the solution now?
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">19:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> are we going to dig out old records to have the whole history present in some form
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">19:46:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or are we going not to?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">19:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'll do it, though I may have to ask you guys for copies of old logs if I don't have
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">19:47:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure. well just say no ;)
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">19:47:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay cool

<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:57:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but in any case, that's now pretty much taken cae of.  Let's move on

<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a new topic
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so we don't write an announcement about this process?
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:59:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't get you

<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:59:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you already have an idea about how this should be done.    Take the AI dude!
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">20:00:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I can take the AI
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">20:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> hmm, a bit disappointing that in four weeks nothing concrete happened on this important topic, if I am allowed to say that
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">20:00:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   I agree.  We should ban holidays  :-)
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">20:00:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> well, yes, holidays granted of course
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">20:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but still.

<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">20:08:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> put that into the announcement
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">20:08:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> that was the idea of the topics list on the portal page
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">20:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> people tend to be more interested in specifics :)
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">20:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">20:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> vuntz,   can't those nitty gritty things be discussed on the foundation ML and make sure everyone is on the same page going forth?    We could spend endless hours talking all the nitty gritties right here and now, but....
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">20:09:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> please don't! hehe
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">20:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> cmon, let's move on :)
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">20:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> exactly!
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">20:09:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're over an hour already on the same topic
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">20:09:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> not that your comments aren't valuable, though, don't get me wrong :)
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">20:10:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well this is the most important topic isnt it?
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">20:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> people are comming here just because of this
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">20:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so please be patient
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">20:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we can skip other topics as needed
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">20:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't agree with that statement  but...  we are being rather slower than normal today
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">20:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yes, of course, but I think that we have one or more steps ahead of us on the matter now
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">20:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> boo f***** woo ;)
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">20:11:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the usual patented Henne-One-Two Pace is missing today  :-D
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">20:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so let's do that first and then more stuff can be discussed on the foundation list
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">20:12:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i just have one question
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">20:12:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> where are we going to discuss this announcement?
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">20:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or arent we going to discuss this? :)
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">20:12:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and it would be more practical to have the wiki page with the current state of things first
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">20:12:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> before the announcement I mean
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">20:13:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> avoids discussing stuff that'll be on that page anyway
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">20:13:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   we could include it in the upcoming Foundation article  at the end  "If you want to know more and get involved... go here"
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">20:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay, good (will take a few more days for the announcement but it's really more practical)
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">20:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> for a marketing guy you really underestimate the impact of this announcement :)
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">20:14:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there is already interest in our community
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">20:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,    no
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">20:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and in the wider FOSS community
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">20:14:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yes, but a few days won't make much of a difference ;)
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">20:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> your question was where to announce and I gave one suggestion as a place to announce it
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">20:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i'm saying we need to make a big splash so people get interested in doing this foundation with us
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">20:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> another place is on the project ML
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">20:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and the forums, etc etc etc
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">20:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">20:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we don't have to spend endless hours discussing where to announce it
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">20:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its common sense
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">20:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> who discusses where to announce it?
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">20:15:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you!
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">20:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so let's channel this through the marketing team and let them help with the logistics and content of the announcment

<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">20:15:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i want to hash out what we want to announce

<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">20:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so as I saw in the original of this topic,  it specifically pertains to removing non-participating team members?
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">20:23:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think prusnak requested that we remove the people in the team that haver never voted until now

<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">20:23:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think that is a very good idea
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">20:23:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think the concept makes sense...
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">20:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> have you voted?

<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">20:23:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But do we require that level of overview?   Or shouldn't we let the team's leadership take care of such internal matters?
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">20:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I'm sure there could be other people who'd be much more useful than me

<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">20:24:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> not sure anyone on the team feels like being the lead on it
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">20:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rhorstkoetter&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I'd vote for suseROCKs' second option
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">20:24:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   then maybe we should encourage leadership in there
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">20:24:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that would be even better

<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">20:30:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR_&gt;</span> there is no point in removing members; we need more voters
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">20:30:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR_&gt;</span> removing wouldn't solve the issue

<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">20:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> because it's pointless to keep people on the team who don't vote and growing the team to e.g. 20 people
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">20:30:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> s/tigerfoot/wolfiR_/
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">20:31:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR,   sure  but the question is who does the recruiting?  I really think the team should be empowered to be able to do recruiting and house cleaning from time to time
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">20:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> ok just the membership acceptance team ... !
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">20:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR_&gt;</span> that's true but telling us that we can remove members is not going to help
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:31:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR_&gt;</span> so tell us that we can replace members would be one
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">20:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR,   That's why I proposed a revision of the action item above...
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">20:31:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">20:31:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it should be to discuss with the team to develop a plan of self management or self governance or however you want to word it
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">20:31:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and I think you could do that on your own

<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">20:32:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> if you know candidates for it, just agree in the team and appoint them to replace those who didn't have the time to participate
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">20:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">20:32:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and as already said, if anyone suspects abuse, the board can be notified

<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">20:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> the only alternative would be that the board puts new people on the team
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">20:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Why?
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">20:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> not sure that changes much, except adding more complexity
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">20:33:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because it opens us up widely for abuse
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">20:33:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it would mean we would have to monitor the team more closely than we currently do.  and I don't want that.
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">20:34:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   the potential for abuse exists just the same as it does today
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">20:34:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how is that?
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">20:34:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we are an elected body of 5 people
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">20:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ok, like this then
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">20:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the team can propose changes on the team to the board
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">20:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and the board says yay or nay
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">20:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> please not: i'm just not sure either way
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">20:35:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> safe enough?
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">20:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah but we have to come up with something anyway
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">20:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> vuntz,   Whats your experience with GNOME membership processes on this matter?
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">20:35:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we don't expect the people on the team to remain there for life ;D
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">20:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> how involved is the Board on its day-to-day activities?
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">20:36:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would feel save(r) with a description the team members
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">20:36:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for instance that they have to be a mamber

<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">20:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> in gnome, the membership committee more or less decides who's part of it, but the board can decide to appoint/veto someone if needed (it never happened)

<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">20:37:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and it seems to have worked for GNOME
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">20:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that's pretty much what I wrote above ^^
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">20:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it's a bit like what we do in opensuse: the board delegated the task to a team, and the team is more or less independent
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">20:38:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> (well, we don't have that second part yet, but that's what some of you proposed :-))
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">20:38:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> that sounds sane too
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">20:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> right, being a member should be a prerequisite
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">20:38:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we never have hashed this out anywhere
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">20:39:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">20:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well we're hashing it out now  :-)
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">20:39:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> needs yet another wiki page of rules ;)
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">20:39:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And I maintain that I don't want the board to be responsible for every personnel change in that team
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">20:40:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it's not like it'll happen every day
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">20:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> and the board will most probably always just "ack"
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">20:40:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no but there needs to be some level of trust when we outsource a function
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">20:40:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but as it is a duty of the board, and as the board trusts the team, and in order to trust the team....
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">20:40:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> outsourcing but everything has to be done and said by the board seems oxymoronic
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">20:40:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yes, of course
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">20:40:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it is
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">20:41:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> This is a very important team.  We need to be carefule on this one.
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">20:41:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but we are talking about changing a fundament of our project
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">20:41:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so lets be careful
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">20:41:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> OTOH the people we delegate the job to must be people we trust
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">20:41:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and frankly a rule to remove a member due to non-voting seems pretty easy to implement on a purely technical matter.   No votes = no participation.    Hard to call abuse on that one
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">20:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would propose that the team can handle its own membership

<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">20:51:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 1.  We need to review and revise the current trademark guidelines.  We have an openfate opened on this, and cornelius is also doing some work on this
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">20:51:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'd like to see us set a timeline for completion of this instead of leaving it open-ended
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">20:52:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 2.  We have some trademark request and reviews to go through, that can be tabled for now
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">20:52:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and 3.  I think this one is kind of important.  We need to really clarify how we've approved requests in the past at the board level because there's really not been very good rhyme or reason to it
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">20:52:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we need to be able to properly convey to the next board just how the heck we arrive at our conclusions
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">20:52:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's my summary
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">20:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">20:54:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;truthslave&gt;</span> hello
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">20:54:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but it'll be difficult to clarify :)
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">20:54:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   Point #3?
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">20:54:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> any questions or such ?
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">20:55:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> oh that again
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">20:55:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yeah
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">20:55:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> please. we have talked about this over and over and over again
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">20:55:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's what I'm afraid of and I think its unfair to hand it to the new group without any guidance
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">20:55:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> always coming to the same conclusion
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">20:55:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the new guidelines will be the guidance
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">20:55:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> granting  trademakrs happens on a case by case decision
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">20:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I think it's pointless tbh, we won't be able to pass any guidelines along, there aren't any with the current state of trademark rules
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">20:56:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "we" didn't come to that conclusion.  I've always disagreed with that line henne
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">20:56:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you brought that topic up countless times
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">20:56:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">20:56:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the new board will have old board members, so they'll be able to explain the spirit if needed, won't they?
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:56:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and were always overruled :)
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:57:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> vuntz,   except I don't even understand how we came to some conclusions  :-)
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:57:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> by the case by case fraction...
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:57:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:57:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> alright fine, we'll drop this subject for henne

<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">21:00:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   timeline we can discuss at next meeting
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">21:00:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;microchip_&gt;</span> disgusting
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">21:00:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> smells like flower
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">21:00:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> requests...  there's one that wasn't a request sent via permission.  but rather  that KimG raised to me to raise to the board the issue of opensuse.us
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">21:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> feels we need to take some action because they're using our trademarks and people see it and assume its an official openSUSE site
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">21:01:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> we need to get that sent via permission.
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">21:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">21:01:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   but that site has been up for years  and they've pointedly don't want to work directly with us
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">21:01:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can you tell that to kim please?
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">21:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we have an action we could say to them to remove trademarks until they go through the proper channels?
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">21:01:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   tell what to Kim?
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">21:02:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that he needs to send that request (he told you) to permission@novell.com
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">21:02:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> did we take a decision on that case ?
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">21:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or permissions
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">21:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no no
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">21:02:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or whatever that thing is
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">21:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,  kim is bringing to our attention what he thinks is a violation
<a name="l-593"></a><span class="tm">21:02:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> he's not asking for permission
<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">21:02:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> he's got nothing to do with the site
<a name="l-595"></a><span class="tm">21:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> that's ok - raising the issue on permissions is the right place
<a name="l-596"></a><span class="tm">21:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I'll tell him to report it there
<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">21:03:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we should then make that clear to eveyrone else that its a place to report as well cuz usually any questions we've dealt with we were contacted directly one way or another
<a name="l-598"></a><span class="tm">21:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> sending to permissions will help it get flagged for the legal lawyers to check into it
<a name="l-599"></a><span class="tm">21:04:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well wait a minute
<a name="l-600"></a><span class="tm">21:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I thought all requests are automatically forwarded to us  and then we pull in lawyers if we need to.  Are you saying now that lawyers review before us?
<a name="l-601"></a><span class="tm">21:05:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> no - what i'm saying is that by getting to us through permissions will help us filter it correctly to the legal
<a name="l-602"></a><span class="tm">21:06:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't think that's been a problem for us before
<a name="l-603"></a><span class="tm">21:06:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I can say henceforth to anyone now   you have an issue, send to permission
<a name="l-604"></a><span class="tm">21:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> although I think it creates a perception issue
<a name="l-605"></a><span class="tm">21:07:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so if not permissions then where?
<a name="l-606"></a><span class="tm">21:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> reporting a problem to an @novell address instead of being able to talk directly to the board seems to harm the perception of board indepndence
<a name="l-607"></a><span class="tm">21:08:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> send to board@?
<a name="l-608"></a><span class="tm">21:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hm
<a name="l-609"></a><span class="tm">21:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that's part of the trademark guidelines review, I'd say
<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">21:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think the point of this is to have one address for all trademarks
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">21:08:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for novell
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">21:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> dunno if that is something they are willing to change
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">21:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   My point isn't the address itself, my point is that we limit the ways people can communicate concerns to the board.
<a name="l-614"></a><span class="tm">21:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But we're getting into nitty gritty details that don't need to be fixed today
<a name="l-615"></a><span class="tm">21:09:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think so too
