<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">16:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> There are two action items
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">16:08:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> number 1 is #663985
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">16:08:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> LinuxTag talks
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">16:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the deadline passed last week but on FOSDEM we got an extension from one of the LT organizers
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">16:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i ran around and talked to people about their submissions
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">16:09:35 </span><span class="nka">* mrdocs</span> <span class="ac">waves</span>
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">16:09:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i will again run around tomorrow and see what they did about it
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">16:09:56 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">places an anvil on mrdocs's hand to stop his waving</span>
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">16:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> after that we should have some nice contributions to LT
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   did you notify ambassadors@ about this as well?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:10:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> all of them are aware of it
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">16:11:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and are we doing a booth there as well?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">16:11:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i have notified -project
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:11:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> about the deadline twice i think
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:11:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes I have put in an application for a booth
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I need to figure out a way to coordinate how we put out calls for such things.   Some people only communicate to marketing/ambassadors and others to only -project.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the Call for Project still runs a bit longer
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:12:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And there's no guarantee that relevant and good speakers are on either lists.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> should we just start cross-posting from now on?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:12:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well putting out a call on some list isnt all you have to do
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:12:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you have to organize a programm. otherwise people will just forget
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed.  I also ping people directly whenever I see someone who is good
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed on that as well
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> organizing means poking people constantly...
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">16:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> my point is we don't always realize we have a greater pool of potential folks than what we see up front
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">16:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I want to cultivate that
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">16:13:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   trust me, I know that.  Seems like its all I do these days re: SCALE  :-)
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">16:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think these things belong onto -project
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">16:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there should be _no one_ active in the project that doesnt read -project
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">16:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> in a way, I do too.  But I'm finding that not everyone is on -project.   (Which means maybe we need to do a better job of marketing -project)  :-)
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">16:14:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no marketeer, no ambassador, no developer
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">16:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed.  Also something I keep telling people.   IF you want to promote the Project, you need to look beyond your l ittle corner.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">16:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i can produce lists of addresses not on -project
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">16:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for every list you can think of
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">16:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you just can ask :)
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">16:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's a repetitive process  :-)
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">16:16:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   how about this?
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">16:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> when people subscribe to a mailing list  (maybe not for all mailing lists)  In the ack message, it says something to the effect of  "By the way, shouldn't you also be on -project?"
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">16:16:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure you would iterate this once in a while...
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">16:17:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no problem. just provide me with the texts
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">16:17:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">16:17:52 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">will need to look at existing acks and see how it is worded now</span>
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">16:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I guess that's an action item for me then  :-D
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">16:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> also are new members auto subscribed ?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">16:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">suseROCKs provide ml-admin@opensuse.org with welcome texts for mailinglists that include suggestion where to subscribe also</span>
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">16:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> might be a good idea so we can spam them :P
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">16:18:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> mrdocs,   I don't think we autosubscribe anyone at this time
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">16:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> GNOME does that.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">16:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> autosubscribe sounds pretty evil to me
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">16:18:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> &lt;evil grin&gt;
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">16:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> something to consider
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">16:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> also we don't really have a very tecnical process there. this would be another manual task for the member officials
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">16:19:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what I get constantly is people saying oh... I didn't know about -project.  How am I supposed to know all these many lists to subscribe to?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">16:19:35 </span><span class="nka">* mrdocs</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>

<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">16:20:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the second AI we have open is about the feature list bug #659659

<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">16:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   wrong setting...  if a tumbleweed is rolling, you'll hear coyotes

<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">16:24:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Teams and individuals send various status reports around. Coolo sends one for the distribution, the OBS team publishes meeting minutes, the boosters their "What are the boosters up to" blogposts, the board has a public meeting and so on and so on. Are there any questions regarding those or do we need to discuss anything in detail?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">16:24:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> You might add where those are posted to the welcome mail
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">16:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so that newbies know the latest happenings with the projects
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">16:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> those?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">16:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we probably do need to do a more structured way of getting status reports from all  (including the teams I'm on)
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">16:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as they provide useful feed for stories on news.o.o
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">16:26:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> those = Coolo, OBS, boosters,...
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">16:26:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as usual guys. the idea is great it just needs someone doing it :)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">16:26:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> either convincing them to do it structured
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">16:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or collect them
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">16:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,    I wasn't giving an idea
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">16:26:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I was saying there's a greater need... now  how do we come up with a way that makes everyone easily do it?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">16:26:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because let's face it,  reporting is not a favorite task amongst humans
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">16:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "I'm too busy doing to say what it is I've been doing!"   :-)
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">16:27:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm   what if we created a status bot or something?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">16:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#status  </span><span class="cmdline">We're working on xyz</span>

<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">16:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (end of week)  We compile it into a report or its viewable in list form for others to look at
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">16:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> like ive said. this is not about ideas HOW to do it
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">16:28:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have tons of those
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">16:28:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is about someone convincing the people that report to do it otherwise
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">16:29:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dude, I'm trying to come up with a way that we can do it simply
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">16:29:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or about someone collecting the information that is out there
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">16:29:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> someone collecting = "status bot"  :-D
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">16:29:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nope
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">16:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">16:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a status bot means that i don't have to switch from blogging about what the boosters to to use a status bot
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">16:30:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> err that I have to switch*
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">16:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no that's not what it means
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">16:30:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> do*
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">16:30:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no?
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">16:30:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so who would feed the status bot?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">16:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> about the boosters
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">16:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it means I don't have to poke everyone on the team to tell me what they've been doing  when I can just as easily look up a web page with this week's statuses and summarize it into a blog post
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">16:31:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and THAT is exactly what is missing
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">16:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> everyone, as they're working would siimply type #status (message)   which is a lot easier than writing a summary or recalling from memory what they did on Monday and its now Friday
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> then go out there and make it happen. code up a status bot and concinve people to use it instead of what they use now
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what do they use now?  :-)
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">16:33:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's move on
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:33:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> mails and blogs
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay are there actually any of the status reports that we need to dicuss?

I'm asking that given yesterday's move, can we somehow expedite some answers from Novell legal on the question of copyrights so that if we feel we need to respond to the move, we have more knowledge in our hands
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">17:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that was my only request here.  You asked for more information on the move itself.   I'm asking for just more legal information
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">17:03:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> That's a different question

<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">17:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> His question is about country of origen for copyright purposes.

<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">17:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hm. from what I understand from that mail thread
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">17:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they struggle with citing material from around the web
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">17:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> There's always a trail somewhere  :-)
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">17:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> including sources like news/lizards
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">17:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok there's not much more we can do on this topic until we get some more information
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">17:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> exactly why I pointed out my confusion earlier - in trying to understand the root of those trails
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">17:10:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> now if the content on those sites is not clearly licensed
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">17:10:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they need to know which laws they need to apply
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">17:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we can only tell them that for our own sites or?
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">17:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> he specifically asks about *.opensuse.org sites in his questions
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">17:11:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> question*
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">17:11:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it has to be.  We can't answer questions for external sites
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">17:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> right.
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">17:12:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so content from us comes exclusively from the wiki which is licensed GFDL
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">17:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> huh?
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">17:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and news/lizards which are not licensed at all
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">17:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">17:13:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> content from us comes from any x.opensuse.org site
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">17:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so I guess to further push the question...   if I write an article for news.o.o, does copyright belong to me or to openSUSE?
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">17:14:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> to novell for now
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">17:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> look at the footer
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">17:15:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm  so that's something to possibly think about for the future with the foundation to transfer those copyrights to the Foundation   I guess.
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">17:15:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> why not move news.o.o to gfdl, too?
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">17:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or to just license news/lizards content
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">17:16:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> actually henne I think you just answered the question.
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">17:17:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> out of curiousity, when you apply a new copyright to a site, does it automatically apply to past posts?
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">17:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay way more complicated then that
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">17:19:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> part of the Sascha question / issue is that the materials are in GFDL his newsletter is CC
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">17:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">17:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> licensing a newsletter is just crazy
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">17:21:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> he should have never opened that box...
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">17:21:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">17:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because its just a document that cites other sources?
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">17:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">17:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">17:22:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a copyright is about more than just content...
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">17:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but again... we need more indepth answers before we can go further
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">17:22:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as AlanClark says i somehow answered the question lets wrap this up
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">17:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we're already 22 minutes over time
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">17:23:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or are there any other questions?
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">17:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> any other topic we need to discuss?
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">17:23:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nada from me, except just a reminder....
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">17:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as later today we will have our first board meeting with newly-elected mrdocs, we will also need to discuss when to have our regular board meetings.
