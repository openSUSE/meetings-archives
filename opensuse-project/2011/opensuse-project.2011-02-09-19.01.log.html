<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:13:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> "Dig out the records of the foundation discussion" is really old now, how about making that less work ? I mean, there's probably no point in digging out all the old stuff
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that is bug #670598

<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I tend to agree.   I think we've gone in such different directions lately that digging up old no longer is relevant
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the current state of things, and why, should certainly be enough to start the discussion
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I would second that we pull out what is needed as we go along
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and to prevent people from starting it all over again
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm also more concerned with whether we should be publishing a foundation direction article either, since we've clearly seen so much FUD going around
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:15:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can we please stay on topic? :)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there's a new round of fud attacking Alan these days btw.  really a rehash of the existing fud

<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:15:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> should we close it?

<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we will never get through AIs if we discuss everything related
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm agreeing with AlanClark and yaloki  that we should close this AI

<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">19:33:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But we decided to wait until the newbies came on board before we determine a good meeting time for board meets

<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">19:33:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 as long as we generate the agenda ahead of the meeting
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">19:33:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm sure henne would love to have earlier board meetings so he's not meeting while at home
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">19:33:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> as long as i plan this is a good time
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">19:33:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so i guess everyone on the board is for the merge
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">19:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> agenda ahead of the meeting is a must
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">19:33:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> myeah
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">19:33:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> a post on news.o.o or anywhere else on planet would be much appreciated
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">19:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> yes and perhaps a mailing a day ahead to -project
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">19:33:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so the only thing remains unsolved: time
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">19:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the "event" thingy on the wiki is weird at best
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">19:34:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">19:34:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> i could not sort it
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">19:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so if that's the case, then I guess meeting for project would start an hour before board?  18:00 UTC?
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">19:34:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> difficult for me
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">19:34:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i thought there will be no more project and board meeting
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">19:34:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> i should say very difficult, but after 2000 CET is ok
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">19:34:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but just one meeting
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">19:34:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">19:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so project meeting at this hour too?
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">19:35:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so please do not distinguish these two anymore
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">19:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> less meetings more time to get stuff done
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">19:35:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> That might be a problem if we're hoping to increase traffic through combination... As this is now evening in Europe, isn't it?
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">19:35:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> +1 for keeping the time
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">19:35:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> or earlier in the day
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> also rupert claims to be unable to make most of the meetings at this hour
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">19:36:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> 1600-1900 difficult with kids+dinner
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:36:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so I'm cool with 16:00  (which is 9 a.m. for AlanClark)   Thoughts?
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:36:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> apparently he isnt able to...

<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">19:36:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm cool with 16:00
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">19:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so we just move all the board topics into the project meeting?
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">19:36:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> or the inverse :)
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">19:37:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> i would call it Board+Project meeting from now on
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">19:37:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think that's the aim

<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">19:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and have only one agenda for it
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the board is a part of the project :)
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:37:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we can just fill the project meeting with life again
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:37:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and the project is part of the board  :-D
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">19:37:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but if it was called only project meeting, people will keep asking where's the board meeting
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and should encourage everyone else to do the same!
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">19:37:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> apparently we need to tell people ;)
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:38:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think that's an education thing, prusnak

<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:38:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so the only one objecting is mrdocs?
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:38:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> title is trivial... can we get back to figuring out the hour???
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:38:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean objecting to the hours
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:38:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 16:00 UTC
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:39:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its a kids thing for him.   That's not something we can work around
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:39:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> very bad for me
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> thats, depending on summer time or not, 17:00 or 18:00 for you
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">19:39:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> also the project meetings are not the most active ones
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">19:39:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> 18:00 until march, then 17:00 i'd guess
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">19:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> 1600-1900 utc is the worst
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">19:39:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we ususally get more participants in here
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">19:39:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anything earlier and we run the risk of a grumpy AlanClark   and we don't want to offend our boss  :-)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">19:39:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> how about we move this question to a doodle with a list of times
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">19:39:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">19:39:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> feed him extra coffee :)

<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">19:40:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> loaded with caffeine :)
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">19:40:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> + keep

<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">19:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> a doodle poll is ok too
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">19:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, for Europe, 16:00-18:00 UTC is typically the time where people leave work and eat
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">19:40:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i agree with creating a doodle

<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">19:42:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i thought we want to move it, but i'm fine with leaving it as it is now
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">19:42:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> isn't that a sign that we should keep them separate ?
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">19:42:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we won't achieve the goal of increasing traffic

<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">19:43:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes and mrdocs cant move to the project meeting time
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">19:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> project meetings, for the most part to me seem like just a mere formality
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">19:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and everyone else is here already during this time :)
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">19:44:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> there will be no optimal time.. but for the board this is very important

<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">19:44:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree with yaloki, project meetings are necessary however small it is
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">19:44:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   both times are business hours for us here in the US

<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">19:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> hence for those, it would be nice to rotate the times

<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">19:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the project meetings at 12:00 UTC make no sense
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">19:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> why?
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">19:45:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> that's a good idea for project meeting if we rotate

<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">19:45:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   I agree... IF there was actual traffic at Project meetings.  But they're so empty and blah its like...why bother?
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">19:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> isn't it empty because the timing is bad ?
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">19:46:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and because it's not properly announced ?
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">19:46:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> In other forums I've tried rotating times - it doesn't work.
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">19:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I would prefer board meetings not be rotated time-wise
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">19:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> What about the marketing meet time, lots of people are there at that time

<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">19:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> how about we had just one time, but we'd put agenda before the meeting on mailinglist, send minutes after and have a discussion on ML as well ?
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">19:47:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as if broadening the discussion would lead to better results

<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">19:47:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   that's how its done on other projects.  GNOME for example.

<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">19:56:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I brought up this topic so I should start the lead on it  :-)
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">19:56:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> good
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">19:56:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> go for it :)
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">19:56:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm concerned that things are going like a train wreck these days.   And I feel that we can no longer respectfully discuss this quietly but to discuss it openly
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">19:57:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because right now the community seems confused about openslx's role and thinking they're doing things authoritatively
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">19:57:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and that's definitely not supposed to be the case here
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">19:57:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can you give an example?
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">19:57:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I feel they've taken advantage of the quiet nature of our discussions rather tahn open public discussion
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">19:58:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   just one?  :-)
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">19:58:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I point to 3 examples:   1.  Their new portal,  2. DVD artwork and 3. yesterday's move of the German OWN to their portal
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">19:58:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> I mean, where people think that theyre doing authorative
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">19:59:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   because people think that what they're doing is the right thing because they're not seeing any discussion publicly around here
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">19:59:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">19:59:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">19:59:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and openslx tells people they have the authority because they've been granted it by Novell
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">19:59:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we're all going "huh?"
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">19:59:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> so we finally have to put the dirty stuff out
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">19:59:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and becaus ethey invest money
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">19:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> "because", even
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">20:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> pah
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> did they tell the Novell tale also on the OWN thing?
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">20:00:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay can we keep this down to specific things? :)
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">20:00:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> no
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">20:00:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago, apparently according to my sources, they are claiming they told Novell of the OWN plans yes
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">20:01:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> uh what?
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">20:01:10 </span><span class="nka">* drago</span> <span class="ac">did not hear about</span>
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">20:01:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> do you know names?
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">20:01:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but in reality, even if they told Novell, or someone in a hallway, that does not constitute communication to the Project
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">20:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> of course not
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">20:01:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">20:02:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i thought henne was about to investigate
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">20:02:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> and I think in Novell all people are on the same page meanwhile
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">20:02:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm not so sure about that drago   TBH
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">20:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> investigate what?
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">20:02:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> i still have the AI to setup a meeting with everybody
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">20:02:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> if people mentioned in the openslx email were aware of the OWN move
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">20:03:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that might not seem so to the open-slx representatives
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">20:03:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   But in our quiet discussions with them, we tried to explain that to them
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">20:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but they are saying they are in the right because they talked to x or y in Nuremberg and that's all they need for approval
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">20:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   that's why I'm also very concerned with your response this morning re: Jacqueline and artwork
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">20:04:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I know the mechanism
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">20:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> than we have a misunderstanding there
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">20:04:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,  because if there's something we don't like after all is done, they will say  But we had approval from Jacqueeline...
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">20:04:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> they will, but that wont help
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">20:05:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   Not we "you and me"    We... us and openslx..   because they WILL twist it around that way
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">20:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> because we will produce the promo dvd
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">20:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it hasn't helped so far!   :-)
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">20:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> and we will use the artwork that comes out of the artwork community
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">20:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> that is out of question
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">20:05:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> and openslx can use whatevertheywant on the commercial box
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">20:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I got no problem with that
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">20:06:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> same
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">20:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but then where are they?
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">20:06:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> and if they want ot play nice, they also check with the community
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">20:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> well...
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">20:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> IF they...
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">20:06:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> where are who?
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">20:06:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  so let's see where that goes
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">20:07:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I doubt we can convince them to go with our design on "their" box
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">20:07:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> tbh, I find the whole attitude very concerning
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">20:07:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   "who" = openslx... I'm seeing no communication from them whatsoever to our teams  and most people aren't getting a response back from them when pinging them
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">20:07:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">20:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> okay
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">20:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,   and I honestly don't care about the boxes.   (to some extent)
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">20:07:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> I can volunteer to try to talk again in person if you want
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">20:07:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> we all do :-/
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">20:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what they do with the boxes is their decision pursuant to whatever is part of the contract they have on it.
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">20:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> yes, but still it would be more nice if the comm-box were also in community design
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">20:08:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> correct
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">20:08:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 1:0!!!!
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">20:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> take that you wine drinking, pizza eating loosers!
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">20:08:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> oh wait. that us too
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">20:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> now yaloki   you have some concerns?
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">20:08:50 </span><span class="nka">* drago</span> <span class="ac">is lost</span>
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">20:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> I'd really like to see an explanation on why german OWN is moving to open-slx.de other than a personal attack on me putting barriers between part of the community
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">20:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> in fact at FOSDEM i found we have a need for separate covers for the promo DVD

<a name="l-508"></a><span class="tm">20:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> "parts" even

<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">20:09:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have to come up with everything now
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">20:09:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> for reference to yaloki's statement, he's saying  http://saigkill.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/german-weekly-news-relaunched/
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">20:09:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> exactly
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">20:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what we put on and around it that is
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">20:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so clear up with me...   we're producing the promo dvds, but they are doing the pressing, right?  or?
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">20:10:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> no need to change the DVD.. just the cover
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">20:10:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, if I may, it's not just about the promo DVD

<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">20:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> understood.. go on..
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">20:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> 1) the platform they set up on community.open-slx.de
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">20:11:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no. we are doing everything
<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">20:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it is a fork of existing infrastructure of opensuse.org
<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">20:11:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no, we're producing it
<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">20:11:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> now, fine, it is certainly a better tool for less experienced people
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">20:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I don't think anyone is or has ever questioned that
<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">20:11:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> they've put a lot of resources into doing it, that's great
<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">20:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> thats why we asked Jacqueline to get offers for the production
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">20:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh then promo dvd + openslx is a non issue here...    never mind
<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">20:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and I don't believe that anyone wants to kill it off

<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">20:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> not having it on an open source platform (which is at least for me an issue=

<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">20:12:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,  well...  the way I see it...  the creation of the portal was problematic.   because it duplicated efforts.
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">20:12:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> our forums aren't opensource software either

<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">20:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> drago,    the name OWN is openSUSE Weekly News... Therefore I would argue that they are using the trademark

<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">20:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there is nothing we can do about that
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">20:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and nothing we should do about that imho

<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">20:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> other then talking to sascha

<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">20:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well he could also have moved it to saigkill.wordpress.com right?
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">20:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It is simply wrong to actively defragment the Project
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">20:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and it still would have been wrong
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">20:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I disagree
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">20:15:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it looks quite a lot like an intentional shift to move all german speaking infrastructure to open-slx.de
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:15:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> instead of opensuse.org
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:15:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and that is the exact opposite direction of what we've been trying to do since many years
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:15:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (especially regarding the forums)
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:15:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes so lets talk to sascha
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:16:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i know
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">20:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so lets talk to sascha :)
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">20:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ah, and they have been lying
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">20:16:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that puts even more reason for concern
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">20:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> the way they have communicated
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">20:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (they = stefan, sebas, saigkill, at least)
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">20:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't believe they've been honest with Sascha

<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">20:17:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> btw, Sascha isn't even an intern,  he's just a volunteer
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">20:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> Could you explain such accusations?
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">20:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> such as sebas stating that open-slx is working on getting their portal under the opensuse.org domain
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">20:17:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> sure, read above
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">20:17:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> you wrote that on your blog a couple of hours after stefan told the board to go eff themselves (not literally, of course)
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">20:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> Rupert has checked how that'd work, no?
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">20:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> checked what?
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">20:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Where is Rupert btw?
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">20:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and also that the OWN move was agreed upon with certain people at novell, we know it's not true
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">20:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> best is to talk to Rupert about that, the forum is his baby and you probably know best how to talk to each other
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">20:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I feel that accusing him of lying is unfair though
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">20:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> I didn't say rupert was lying
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">20:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,   but you're the one who broke everything when we were attempting to negotiate a good compromise for everyone
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">20:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> what bothers me a bit is the amount of pushback we get when we try to do things in a new way
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">20:19:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> you really really wonder about that?
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">20:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I'd at least expect inertia, not negative pushback
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">20:19:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> actually, lemme rephrase: you lied (or were extremely misinformed, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that), and stefan lied
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">20:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> new way has to be different from secret way
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">20:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas, right smack in the middle of a meeting negotiating a truce one day ahead of the planned announcement of the portal, you went ahead and announced the portal when you guys knew fully well we were talking to you about it.
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">20:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so the new way is doing stuff in your corner, duplicating existing infrastructure and then just not care about pissing people off ?
<a name="l-593"></a><span class="tm">20:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yes, I do, but it seems to be comon to be met with infinite arguments, rather than some form of encouragement for new cool stuff
<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">20:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> in your own primary community, what would happen if i start a new techbase for KDE on kde.opensuse.org?
<a name="l-595"></a><span class="tm">20:20:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a lot of good faith was erased when you changed at will
<a name="l-596"></a><span class="tm">20:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> if you look closely, you'll find that what you make "duplicate infrastructure" is actually different in approach *and* target
<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">20:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> or starting kde.open-slx.de for german speaking part of the kde project
<a name="l-598"></a><span class="tm">20:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,   the point we're trying to make is  "Where is the discussion???"
<a name="l-599"></a><span class="tm">20:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> good point

<a name="l-604"></a><span class="tm">20:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "anymore discussion in openSUSE??"  how about an actual discussion???
<a name="l-605"></a><span class="tm">20:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I'm much more inclined to work with the people that have cool ideas and motivation than endlessly discussing what we may do, and how we have to fit it all in
<a name="l-606"></a><span class="tm">20:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay, so no need to be "concerned" any more, know we know for sure
<a name="l-607"></a><span class="tm">20:22:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so why would everyone else work for "you" then ?
<a name="l-608"></a><span class="tm">20:22:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so your way or the highway? :)
<a name="l-609"></a><span class="tm">20:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,    that's an insult to the project.  This project has really begun to move forward, and people are working on improving things and then all of asudden they find openslx has stolen the flooor from under them when they've put so many hours of their free time into something
<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">20:22:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> if you and others at open-slx don't think they need to discuss it with the rest of the community ?
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">20:22:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean, is that right???
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">20:22:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I don't need nor do I want everyone to work for me
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">20:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> okay, obviously this cannot be solved over IRC, and certainly not if only one person from openslx is present
<a name="l-614"></a><span class="tm">20:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> you changed your understanding of community?

<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">20:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> and I think I shouldn't be thrown stones in my way when doing a couple of crazy things

<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">20:23:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> can we agree on some phonecall or even personal meeting?

<a name="l-623"></a><span class="tm">20:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> openslx is based in NUE, right ?
<a name="l-624"></a><span class="tm">20:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or nearby
<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">20:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well that's even worse, I could have understood statements like those when being angry
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">20:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> can we get stefan or whoever is the powers that be to get this sorted with the board
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">20:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> My intention is much more to give some facts about what we're doing, maybe understanding leads to less pushback
<a name="l-628"></a><span class="tm">20:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> facts would be nice... ahead of time
<a name="l-629"></a><span class="tm">20:25:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> you really want to continue to ride the dead horse that we're not understanding what your doing?
<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">20:25:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> how is it a pushback, you just do what you want without caring about the others
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">20:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> my understanding is that the board and Stefan know very well where to find us

<a name="l-633"></a><span class="tm">20:25:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> the HOW is the problem
<a name="l-634"></a><span class="tm">20:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> often the result is though to ask us to delay anything, and that just doesn't always work
<a name="l-635"></a><span class="tm">20:25:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> either you start to talk to us on that level (the HOW level) or this will just escalate further
<a name="l-636"></a><span class="tm">20:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> right, the two blog posts would have been a week later
<a name="l-637"></a><span class="tm">20:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> what's "escalating"?
<a name="l-638"></a><span class="tm">20:26:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> the whole situation
<a name="l-639"></a><span class="tm">20:26:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> you might consider that it's not just "two blog posts later", but a later launch of an end-user support platform
<a name="l-640"></a><span class="tm">20:26:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> between openSUSE and open-slx
<a name="l-641"></a><span class="tm">20:26:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,  I hardly think asking openslx to delay a few days so we can all come to a positive understanding was too much to ask for.  Seriously!    Instead you, yes you!...  decided to buck what was already agreed upon and moved the launch one day earlier.
<a name="l-642"></a><span class="tm">20:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> that's our product, so even if it's not important to you, it might be to others
<a name="l-643"></a><span class="tm">20:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> aha
<a name="l-644"></a><span class="tm">20:27:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> "that's our product"
<a name="l-645"></a><span class="tm">20:27:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> maybe, but not to the project, which we stand for here
<a name="l-646"></a><span class="tm">20:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's the point... it was important to us to understand how and why it had to come to this.   But there's no discussion at all
<a name="l-647"></a><span class="tm">20:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well 99% of "your product" is the community's
<a name="l-648"></a><span class="tm">20:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> yeah, end-user support ... is that any new?
<a name="l-649"></a><span class="tm">20:27:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and not wanting to talk with those 99% is surprising, to say the least
<a name="l-650"></a><span class="tm">20:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> exactly, and we all need to learn how we can make companies who want to build a project on top of openSUSE and contribute back live's easy
<a name="l-651"></a><span class="tm">20:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and we're telling you: come talk to use with whatever you do
<a name="l-652"></a><span class="tm">20:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> open-slx is maybe one fine example for a company that is not Novell to get substantially integrated in the openSUSE ecosystem
<a name="l-653"></a><span class="tm">20:28:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> sure, and we all have to learn to play fair
<a name="l-654"></a><span class="tm">20:28:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> you frequently ignore that
<a name="l-655"></a><span class="tm">20:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> the point really is: where do we draw these lines

<a name="l-673"></a><span class="tm">20:31:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> or to move the OWN to open-slx.de
<a name="l-674"></a><span class="tm">20:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> nope. i mean specifically those two things now
<a name="l-675"></a><span class="tm">20:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> So, that's one of our products, ok? Why would we need an OK from the openSUSE board for that?
<a name="l-676"></a><span class="tm">20:32:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you don't need an OK from the opensuse board for that

<a name="l-678"></a><span class="tm">20:32:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you need to do these things inside the opensuse community
<a name="l-679"></a><span class="tm">20:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you need to be transparent
<a name="l-680"></a><span class="tm">20:32:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or the board, as representatives of this project, will stand up and tell you that this sucks
<a name="l-681"></a><span class="tm">20:32:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> and that's exactly the problem, there seems to be very little wiggle room for new things
<a name="l-682"></a><span class="tm">20:32:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and you need to stop assuming that talking to someone at Novell = approval
<a name="l-683"></a><span class="tm">20:32:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> why do you say that?
<a name="l-684"></a><span class="tm">20:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> basically, everything gets more complicated, we got this impression after the wiki project
<a name="l-685"></a><span class="tm">20:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> watching this from my not completely impartial standpoint, i think you need a mediator
<a name="l-686"></a><span class="tm">20:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> if you have worked with the community on making this happen, like everybody else, you can do a lot of things
<a name="l-687"></a><span class="tm">20:33:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> where you == (board, openslx)
<a name="l-688"></a><span class="tm">20:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> so with the end-user support platform, we wanted to create something, and then have people evaluate it
<a name="l-689"></a><span class="tm">20:33:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> yes. thats the wrong approach
<a name="l-690"></a><span class="tm">20:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> release early, release often
<a name="l-691"></a><span class="tm">20:33:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> we have worked with some people in the community that delivered lots of positive energy
<a name="l-692"></a><span class="tm">20:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> there is not enough assumption of good faith on either side
<a name="l-693"></a><span class="tm">20:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Bille,   Stefan asked that I be a mediator between them and Novell since I knew very little about them...   But right now, I need assurances that everyone will act in good faith in the mediation, and they're not.
<a name="l-694"></a><span class="tm">20:33:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> that doesn't include everybody, of course
<a name="l-695"></a><span class="tm">20:34:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> there is not a single mention of this on ANY of our communication channels
<a name="l-696"></a><span class="tm">20:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> Yes, because it's a product launch
<a name="l-697"></a><span class="tm">20:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> its not possible for ANYONE to participate that you don't ask
<a name="l-698"></a><span class="tm">20:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you're not impartial enough.
<a name="l-699"></a><span class="tm">20:34:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> public mailinglists don't work so well with product marketing
<a name="l-700"></a><span class="tm">20:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and we're an open source project

<a name="l-702"></a><span class="tm">20:34:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Bille,   The things that I uncovered in the last month just turned me off
<a name="l-703"></a><span class="tm">20:35:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's difficult to be impartial when you've been lied to
<a name="l-704"></a><span class="tm">20:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> well tough luck. this is an open source community
<a name="l-705"></a><span class="tm">20:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> i wonder if ungethym would step in here as well and try to filter out the he said, she said.
<a name="l-706"></a><span class="tm">20:35:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes yaloki   that's the problem.
<a name="l-707"></a><span class="tm">20:35:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and if you need to do something in private and secretive youre wrong here
<a name="l-708"></a><span class="tm">20:35:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> seriously. somehow you need to integrate your efforts into this community
<a name="l-709"></a><span class="tm">20:35:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so, let's take a step back
<a name="l-710"></a><span class="tm">20:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> or else we will always have this problem
<a name="l-711"></a><span class="tm">20:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> it's not like novell don't have secrets :-)
<a name="l-712"></a><span class="tm">20:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> there is obviously a communication issue
<a name="l-713"></a><span class="tm">20:36:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> exactly
<a name="l-714"></a><span class="tm">20:36:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I'm not sure, are you threatening?
<a name="l-715"></a><span class="tm">20:36:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> sebas thinks we're just pushing back
<a name="l-716"></a><span class="tm">20:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cb400f,   it doens't matter if Novell has secrets.  openSUSE is not Novell.  openSUSE belongs to the community.
<a name="l-717"></a><span class="tm">20:36:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> sebas thinks we want to kill off what they're doing
<a name="l-718"></a><span class="tm">20:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I'm a bit disappointed that this is all you understood, yaloki
<a name="l-719"></a><span class="tm">20:37:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we think that by doing it how they do, they are pissing off people
<a name="l-720"></a><span class="tm">20:37:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> that's all you've been saying

<a name="l-722"></a><span class="tm">20:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   except we don't *think* that.  We've already gotten such complaints and concerns
<a name="l-723"></a><span class="tm">20:37:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> there is one more thing to talk about, which would make both working with community assets and infrastructure easier, and that's trademarks
<a name="l-724"></a><span class="tm">20:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> that is work in progress
<a name="l-725"></a><span class="tm">20:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> no sorry. there is only one thing to talk about. how you change the HOW of your doings
<a name="l-726"></a><span class="tm">20:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,  you're aware we're currently in trademarks review overhaul, right?
<a name="l-727"></a><span class="tm">20:38:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I know that the trademark stuff is not exactly trivial in general for a Free Software project, and probably even worse with trademarks being in Novell's hands, but it does cause some concern wrt to continuity
<a name="l-728"></a><span class="tm">20:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> because you are receiving pushback, very clearly now
<a name="l-729"></a><span class="tm">20:38:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I'm glad to hear that
<a name="l-730"></a><span class="tm">20:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I'm just trying to summarize the positions a bit
<a name="l-731"></a><span class="tm">20:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> then please correct me
<a name="l-732"></a><span class="tm">20:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and let's hear you out
<a name="l-733"></a><span class="tm">20:39:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,   seriously?  You didn't know?  i thought you had a handle on what's going on in the community?
<a name="l-734"></a><span class="tm">20:39:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> mmm let's not go there
<a name="l-735"></a><span class="tm">20:39:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> To be quite honest, I'm not sure telling me how exactly I've to do my work is very productive
<a name="l-736"></a><span class="tm">20:39:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> please, see above, if you're disappointed on my summary, then please correct me
<a name="l-737"></a><span class="tm">20:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> how did I misrepresent your opinion/position ?
<a name="l-738"></a><span class="tm">20:40:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Well, my last status is that we're not sure what novell wants with the trademark, or Attachmate
<a name="l-739"></a><span class="tm">20:40:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,   it s not about how you do your work, its about taking away the work from others who were already working on something
<a name="l-740"></a><span class="tm">20:40:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1
<a name="l-741"></a><span class="tm">20:40:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> okay, that was a better formulation
<a name="l-742"></a><span class="tm">20:40:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-743"></a><span class="tm">20:40:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I'm not following every detail, I'd love to, but can't
<a name="l-744"></a><span class="tm">20:40:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so again. your way or the highway
<a name="l-745"></a><span class="tm">20:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I'm really sorry you feel that way
<a name="l-746"></a><span class="tm">20:40:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> eh
<a name="l-747"></a><span class="tm">20:41:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> me too
<a name="l-748"></a><span class="tm">20:41:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,  You feel somewhat threatened and offended by how we're "telling you how to do your work".   Don't you think the same feeling applies to the others who were doing the same work?
<a name="l-749"></a><span class="tm">20:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> alright, we won't get any further on this I guess, at least not here and now
<a name="l-750"></a><span class="tm">20:41:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> the "overall feeling" I get from this is that you make it very hard to do something cool with openSUSE, and that does bother me
<a name="l-751"></a><span class="tm">20:41:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean, its not about technicalities here.  Its about being decent and doing the right thing and acknowledging what people are and have already done
<a name="l-752"></a><span class="tm">20:42:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> neither of those, I just think it's unrealistic
<a name="l-753"></a><span class="tm">20:42:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> which is pretty much what I said above
<a name="l-754"></a><span class="tm">20:42:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> yes making it the way you do it we make hard
<a name="l-755"></a><span class="tm">20:42:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so, tell me one thing
<a name="l-756"></a><span class="tm">20:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> put yourself into the position of those who were putting their free time into the german speaking forums on opensuse.org
<a name="l-757"></a><span class="tm">20:42:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> they were not involved into your portal
<a name="l-758"></a><span class="tm">20:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> and suddenly, out of the blue, your portal is there
<a name="l-759"></a><span class="tm">20:42:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> Is it OK, wanted, or "rather not" if I pass this discussion on to Stefan, btw?
<a name="l-760"></a><span class="tm">20:43:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> so, how would you feel then ?
<a name="l-761"></a><span class="tm">20:43:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> seriously, you don't feel that open-slx is fragmenting the german-speaking community?
<a name="l-762"></a><span class="tm">20:43:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> I gather you'd want him to read your requests
<a name="l-763"></a><span class="tm">20:43:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> this is public

<a name="l-766"></a><span class="tm">20:44:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sebas,   I'd love to see us come back to the table.   It was openslx that walked away from the table.   We're still here waiting
<a name="l-767"></a><span class="tm">20:44:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> btw, my motivation to talk about this is because I'd love to see things working well, and I'm not really interested in pissing people off or anything like that

<a name="l-769"></a><span class="tm">20:45:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> but also not about being told how I would handle things
<a name="l-770"></a><span class="tm">20:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then get us back to the table, sir  :-)
<a name="l-771"></a><span class="tm">20:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and I'm thirsty
<a name="l-772"></a><span class="tm">20:45:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> it doesn't really affect what I'm working on technically, either
<a name="l-773"></a><span class="tm">20:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> cause the bar is closed
<a name="l-774"></a><span class="tm">20:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> not sure it fits into the analogy though :)
<a name="l-775"></a><span class="tm">20:45:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> yes, seems so
<a name="l-776"></a><span class="tm">20:45:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we had a wonderful opportunity to work things out early in January, and instead its gotten more full-blown beceause there's an unwillingness to talk.
<a name="l-777"></a><span class="tm">20:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so sebas   if you really care, then I urge you to encourage your superiors strenuously to come to the table.  There is always compromise somewhere in life.

<a name="l-780"></a><span class="tm">20:47:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> and the irony is that Rupert is really the best person to talk to, and at least henne is and yaloki was on the same board of directors

<a name="l-797"></a><span class="tm">20:50:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah we seriously need to work this out somehow
<a name="l-798"></a><span class="tm">20:50:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay next topic
<a name="l-799"></a><span class="tm">20:50:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">openSUSE Strategy</span>
<a name="l-800"></a><span class="tm">20:50:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have two sub-stopics
<a name="l-801"></a><span class="tm">20:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 1. Board review and action due when?
<a name="l-802"></a><span class="tm">20:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> before we go on....
<a name="l-803"></a><span class="tm">20:50:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> honestly, it isn't my favourite way of spending the night, quite stressful to talk to 5+ people at once
<a name="l-804"></a><span class="tm">20:51:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's take an agreement... do we want to spend the whole agenda today or do a cutoff?  since we're already at almost 2 hours
<a name="l-805"></a><span class="tm">20:51:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> i don't particularly like 5 people talking to you at once either ;)
<a name="l-806"></a><span class="tm">20:52:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I don't particularly find 5 people liking me all at once either  :-)
<a name="l-807"></a><span class="tm">20:52:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you ask as you had something better to do :)
<a name="l-808"></a><span class="tm">20:52:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drago&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sebas:</span> come on, I saw you managing 15 at a time ;-)
<a name="l-809"></a><span class="tm">20:52:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hey prusnak ... watch it!  :-D
<a name="l-810"></a><span class="tm">20:52:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sebas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">drago:</span> yeah, as long as nobody asks questions and just listens, it seems to scale
<a name="l-811"></a><span class="tm">20:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> lets see how far we come until 21:00 UTC okay?
<a name="l-812"></a><span class="tm">20:52:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think that we can do a quick action on the strategy topic.
<a name="l-813"></a><span class="tm">20:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or 21:30 UTC
<a name="l-814"></a><span class="tm">20:52:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 21:00 is in 9 minutes, right?
<a name="l-815"></a><span class="tm">20:52:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-816"></a><span class="tm">20:53:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> kepp going
<a name="l-817"></a><span class="tm">20:53:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's close at 21:00
<a name="l-818"></a><span class="tm">20:53:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i will bring up cutting the meeting at 21:30 again. good?
<a name="l-819"></a><span class="tm">20:53:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> go +1
<a name="l-820"></a><span class="tm">20:53:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> +1

<a name="l-826"></a><span class="tm">20:54:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's have mrdocs speak on this topic.  Then I have a proposal for an action item
<a name="l-827"></a><span class="tm">20:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think there is only one action item
<a name="l-828"></a><span class="tm">20:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> put this up for a vote
<a name="l-829"></a><span class="tm">20:55:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> well just 2 short comments:  the current strategy statement is IMO not what we want, nor does it reflect reality
<a name="l-830"></a><span class="tm">20:56:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> pays henne $1
<a name="l-831"></a><span class="tm">20:56:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> who is we?
<a name="l-832"></a><span class="tm">20:56:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is what we (ALL OF US) have come up with
<a name="l-833"></a><span class="tm">20:56:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> in a very lengthy and painful process
<a name="l-834"></a><span class="tm">20:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so who is your "we"? :)
<a name="l-835"></a><span class="tm">20:57:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> 2. its way too long, too vague and needs to be less about what we are, but shoulf be about what we want to be.. aspirational.. simple and motivating
<a name="l-836"></a><span class="tm">20:57:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> overall community
<a name="l-837"></a><span class="tm">20:57:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we do need a strategy statement in place rather soon.   Especially the marketing team.
<a name="l-838"></a><span class="tm">20:58:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> oh i know
<a name="l-839"></a><span class="tm">20:58:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> but this is what the overall community came up with?
<a name="l-840"></a><span class="tm">20:58:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> and to a native speaker it looks like edited by community.. no disrespect to those who speak En as 2nd, 3rd language
<a name="l-841"></a><span class="tm">20:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> s/community/committee
<a name="l-842"></a><span class="tm">20:59:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> what i would like to do is quickly try to condense this into something shorter and clarity
<a name="l-843"></a><span class="tm">20:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> here's the thing...  when we did all our strategy discussions, we never really put in a good timeframe for completion.
<a name="l-844"></a><span class="tm">20:59:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it _is_ edited by committee
<a name="l-845"></a><span class="tm">21:00:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and without a timeframe, we will discuss endlessly.  There will never be a statement that appeases everyone
<a name="l-846"></a><span class="tm">21:00:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> fine for the concepts.. not for the final edits
<a name="l-847"></a><span class="tm">21:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but if there are some really bad things in the current statement, then we need to review, and revise and send it back to the committee for improvement
<a name="l-848"></a><span class="tm">21:00:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> quickly
<a name="l-849"></a><span class="tm">21:00:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> the entire declaration of independence, one of the great works of English was written by one person ;)
<a name="l-850"></a><span class="tm">21:01:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-851"></a><span class="tm">21:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> mrdocs,   yeah but he used ctrl+c/ctrl-v   :-D
<a name="l-852"></a><span class="tm">21:01:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hm but editing this means it has to go back to the committee(s)
<a name="l-853"></a><span class="tm">21:01:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> I propose: AlanClark and get together and do our tweaks
<a name="l-854"></a><span class="tm">21:01:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> mrdocs types faster than I do
<a name="l-855"></a><span class="tm">21:02:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I'm sorry but _every_ sentence in this document was molded under great pain
<a name="l-856"></a><span class="tm">21:02:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> integrating all those concepts into something shorter and more and consise
<a name="l-857"></a><span class="tm">21:02:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> i understand completely
<a name="l-858"></a><span class="tm">21:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> just editing it just isnt going to solve anything
<a name="l-859"></a><span class="tm">21:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> didn't Jos already make "mission statement" which was 3-4 lines thing
<a name="l-860"></a><span class="tm">21:02:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   let's see what they come up with in the next...  2 weeks?
<a name="l-861"></a><span class="tm">21:02:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> as it is it us not usable for marketing, nor is it inspiring
<a name="l-862"></a><span class="tm">21:03:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> really
<a name="l-863"></a><span class="tm">21:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> i don't question that
<a name="l-864"></a><span class="tm">21:03:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i'm just saying: we have tasked a team of people
<a name="l-865"></a><span class="tm">21:03:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> with creating that document
<a name="l-866"></a><span class="tm">21:03:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> again, let's just put this to the test and let them propose their edits and we see again in 2 weeks.   Is that okay?
<a name="l-867"></a><span class="tm">21:03:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and now we're going to edit it?
<a name="l-868"></a><span class="tm">21:03:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> im game for an alternative... i just think this is the most expedient
<a name="l-869"></a><span class="tm">21:04:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> i think ANY edit leads to more month of discussing this edit
<a name="l-870"></a><span class="tm">21:04:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> hell if we don't edit this in any way and just say
<a name="l-871"></a><span class="tm">21:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hey we edited it
<a name="l-872"></a><span class="tm">21:04:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   but the point is after their edits, we may see the reasoning more clearly than we do now
<a name="l-873"></a><span class="tm">21:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we would end up with another 6 months of discussion
<a name="l-874"></a><span class="tm">21:05:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so henne your voting that we post the document?
<a name="l-875"></a><span class="tm">21:05:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-876"></a><span class="tm">21:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the quality of the dits don't matter
<a name="l-877"></a><span class="tm">21:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> they may have some really good sound advice for a clearer proposal, and after all, even with a committee, the strategy statement is still a board initiative and needsd the full confidence of the board if we're going to implement it.
<a name="l-878"></a><span class="tm">21:05:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> edits*
<a name="l-879"></a><span class="tm">21:05:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> no... as I will preamble the proposal with the exact reasoning for why we did what
<a name="l-880"></a><span class="tm">21:05:39 </span><span class="nka">* mrdocs</span> <span class="ac">has some good arguments in his pocket</span>

<a name="l-882"></a><span class="tm">21:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> and this will spark another round of discussions

<a name="l-1036"></a><span class="tm">21:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   when you and I took our stand in December it was about getting things out into the open and more transparent
<a name="l-1037"></a><span class="tm">21:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> where everything is visbile
<a name="l-1038"></a><span class="tm">21:31:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> *visible
<a name="l-1039"></a><span class="tm">21:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but to my surprise during our stand in December, you went compeletely to the opposite end of the spectrum and basically completely removed it from board management
<a name="l-1040"></a><span class="tm">21:32:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so if things do get out of hand  (do you really think people diligently follow rules?) on the mailing list the way it is... that's really the very nature of it.
<a name="l-1041"></a><span class="tm">21:33:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean some of the topics being discussed so far really have no relevance to the immeidate establishment of the foundation and the necessary paperwork we're supposed to be focusing on
<a name="l-1042"></a><span class="tm">21:34:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Where's our leadership on this?
<a name="l-1043"></a><span class="tm">21:35:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> umm... did I forget to pay my ISP bill?
<a name="l-1044"></a><span class="tm">21:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> hm, so do you propose to restart a discussion again, or to keep discussion going and focus on the paperwork?
<a name="l-1045"></a><span class="tm">21:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> I disagree that the topics are relevant
<a name="l-1046"></a><span class="tm">21:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't think we can go back to the middle ground that I thought we were going for before.   It just makes people suspecious  :-)
<a name="l-1047"></a><span class="tm">21:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I think we definitely need to make sure the topics are focused on what needs to be done first, second third. etc.
<a name="l-1048"></a><span class="tm">21:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so what is wrong with the way I did?
<a name="l-1049"></a><span class="tm">21:38:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Do we even have a set of priorities of what needs to be done?
<a name="l-1050"></a><span class="tm">21:38:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> go look at the portal page
<a name="l-1051"></a><span class="tm">21:38:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean I thought the only thing left to be done was to get the bylaws written up and submitted so we can have a foundation in a short while
<a name="l-1052"></a><span class="tm">21:38:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes please
<a name="l-1053"></a><span class="tm">21:39:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'll look at it again
<a name="l-1054"></a><span class="tm">21:39:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I have to admit its discouraging to see what will turn into hundreds of foundation mail flying by my inbox
<a name="l-1055"></a><span class="tm">21:40:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> that's why I liked henne's suggestion for focus
<a name="l-1056"></a><span class="tm">21:40:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you want an open and transparent discussion
<a name="l-1057"></a><span class="tm">21:40:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> without many emails in your inbox?
<a name="l-1058"></a><span class="tm">21:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> to keep the hundreds of emails on the same topic
<a name="l-1059"></a><span class="tm">21:40:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no that's not what I'm saying
<a name="l-1060"></a><span class="tm">21:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-1061"></a><span class="tm">21:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what I'm saying is that if this is still a board initiative, then shouldn't the board be the one setting the topics and moderating?   Not just whomever creates a thread?
<a name="l-1062"></a><span class="tm">21:41:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If it isn't, then remove Foundation topic from board meetings altogether
<a name="l-1063"></a><span class="tm">21:41:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we all agreed that we need to broaded the gruop of people that drive this

<a name="l-1069"></a><span class="tm">21:42:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we didn't agree to relinquish driving it from the board.
<a name="l-1070"></a><span class="tm">21:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay then there is the misunderstanding
<a name="l-1071"></a><span class="tm">21:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I tend to agree with suseROCKS.  The board has the background and knowledge of prior discussions.
<a name="l-1072"></a><span class="tm">21:43:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-1073"></a><span class="tm">21:43:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and we need to share this knowledge
<a name="l-1074"></a><span class="tm">21:43:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the community entrusted us with leadership, we shouldn't just give it away at the drop of a dime
<a name="l-1075"></a><span class="tm">21:43:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> plus the domain knowledge
<a name="l-1076"></a><span class="tm">21:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> That will help keep the topics from rehashing
<a name="l-1077"></a><span class="tm">21:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (or what's the Euro equivalent of a dime?)
<a name="l-1078"></a><span class="tm">21:43:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and we need to make other people OWN this foundation
<a name="l-1079"></a><span class="tm">21:44:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> even if this means re-discussing things
<a name="l-1080"></a><span class="tm">21:44:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for us
<a name="l-1081"></a><span class="tm">21:44:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> 10 centimes...
<a name="l-1082"></a><span class="tm">21:44:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   why wouldn't they feel that way?    Technically, the community OWNS the board, doesn't it?
<a name="l-1083"></a><span class="tm">21:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> because they can't lead
<a name="l-1084"></a><span class="tm">21:45:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they cant decide
<a name="l-1085"></a><span class="tm">21:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> BINGO!
<a name="l-1086"></a><span class="tm">21:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they can't make it theirs
<a name="l-1087"></a><span class="tm">21:45:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and the foundation might be something we have started
<a name="l-1088"></a><span class="tm">21:45:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so they should trust our leadership in driving what topics are currently to be discussed and relevant and what we've already come to conclusions on
<a name="l-1089"></a><span class="tm">21:46:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but for it to succeed we need many more people to drive it
<a name="l-1090"></a><span class="tm">21:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as you yourself have said, you want to get everyone off of square one and onto square 43297201 that we're already on
<a name="l-1091"></a><span class="tm">21:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   drive it or participate in it?  I' have no bones with participation.  I'm all for it
<a name="l-1092"></a><span class="tm">21:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes. that means we need to explain to them how we came to conclusions
<a name="l-1093"></a><span class="tm">21:46:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but like a vehicle, you can only have 1 driver (or 2 if you have co pilot) per vehicle
<a name="l-1094"></a><span class="tm">21:46:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this does not mean that we declare ourselves special over them
<a name="l-1095"></a><span class="tm">21:48:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this vehicle that needs a complete crew to drive!
<a name="l-1096"></a><span class="tm">21:48:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-1097"></a><span class="tm">21:48:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but even with a crew, there's a designated leader, isn't there?
<a name="l-1098"></a><span class="tm">21:49:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes and thats us
<a name="l-1099"></a><span class="tm">21:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> im kinda with suseROCKs... its the nature of hackers... most *want* to have good direction and leadership
<a name="l-1100"></a><span class="tm">21:49:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-1101"></a><span class="tm">21:50:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i give up
<a name="l-1102"></a><span class="tm">21:50:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> so what do you want ?
<a name="l-1103"></a><span class="tm">21:50:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   ok so where is our "designated leadership" in this module?   I'm open to hearing
<a name="l-1104"></a><span class="tm">21:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you have it your way
<a name="l-1105"></a><span class="tm">21:50:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> individual board members moderate the topics
<a name="l-1106"></a><span class="tm">21:50:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> err i do not want you walking away pissed.. its too important
<a name="l-1107"></a><span class="tm">21:51:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> looking over the discussion rules, we have set the topics, we have the most knowledge
<a name="l-1108"></a><span class="tm">21:51:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> i'm not :)
<a name="l-1109"></a><span class="tm">21:51:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> good :)
<a name="l-1110"></a><span class="tm">21:51:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> i really don't have a problem with loosing an argument or being overules
<a name="l-1111"></a><span class="tm">21:51:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> overruled
<a name="l-1112"></a><span class="tm">21:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> same :)
<a name="l-1113"></a><span class="tm">21:51:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> look here's the thing...
<a name="l-1114"></a><span class="tm">21:52:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> generally I expressed an opinion, because you asked me.
<a name="l-1115"></a><span class="tm">21:52:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but its easier when we are sharing a beer in the booth :)
<a name="l-1116"></a><span class="tm">21:52:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But I don't think we can easily undo where we are at now... because it would just look really bad to take it back so to speak
<a name="l-1117"></a><span class="tm">21:52:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so let's just trudge forward and be mindful that there is a possibility that things get out of hand but that we hope henne's rules work well
<a name="l-1118"></a><span class="tm">21:52:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the fix now is our participation on the ML
<a name="l-1119"></a><span class="tm">21:53:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Ok - looking at the time.   Let's stick with the current moderators.  We can revisit this later if needed
<a name="l-1120"></a><span class="tm">21:53:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> mrdocs,    in my opinion, when we participate in the ML we're participating as just any participant, not as a board member
<a name="l-1121"></a><span class="tm">21:53:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> AlanClark is the voice of reason :)

<a name="l-1150"></a><span class="tm">21:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light
<a name="l-1151"></a><span class="tm">21:58:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> because red is ugly
