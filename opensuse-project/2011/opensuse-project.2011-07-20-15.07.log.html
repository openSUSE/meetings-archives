<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but I think we have enough people now  :-)
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes let's push forward
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Agenda:
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Before we go forward, quick question....   Has someone made sure all the "mailed" proposals are recorded in Indico?

<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I and Jos have tried to catch those that mail to cfp and direct them to indigo
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I know of 3 that are discussing, but haven't submitted cfp's yet
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:10:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  and you're fairly certain we have caught them all?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I hope so
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  you have the floor and agenda then  :-)
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Here's what I propose for the Agenda. (By the way I'd like to make this a fast meeting)
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:11:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 1. The process to complete the review of session proposals
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 2. Identify where we still have some holes in CFPs
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 3. Keynotes
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 4. BoFs
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:12:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> also there is a list of tasks for you guys here:
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_todo_list#Program
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Thank you henne
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> thanks, henne
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> anything to add to the agenda?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:13:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I think we can not do 2. properly
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I guess the "tasks discussion" would be concurrent with all the agenda items
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:14:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> because I guess most of us havent screened yet
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:14:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but we can try
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> good agenda IMO
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,    I sent an email to CFP that kind o helped categorize where we are.    Hav eyou seen it?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:14:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I included my thoughts on "holes" as they exist
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> seen yes, but not gone through in detail
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's move on to topic 1.   This is critical
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's save that for #2.  Let's start with 31
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> start with #1
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I send a proposal around which hopefully works out utilizing Indico
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> have you guys seen/read it?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes - I liked it and would propose that we follow it; adding a timetable
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> simple process, works for me
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   yes.    What's unclear to me is  the process of voting.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:17:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean we can easily go through and "like/dislike" but then we need a process for which ones we like that will actually make it.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Actually, let's clear up one thing...  How many sessions do we have?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:18:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well, the one with the most dislikes do not make it
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> IMO
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes that part is obvious  :-)  Its the likes I'm concerned with.   And number of sessions impacts number of likes to be accepted.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> also, some sessions will not be standard 1-hour  (e.g. workshops or hacksessions)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:19:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but if we can get a ballpark figure, that would help our process immensely
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I dont understand the "ballpark figure"
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can you explain?
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:20:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ballpark figure  (I guess this is an American phrase)  means rough estimate
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> To estimate low, I would say 3 rooms * 4 days * 6 sessions/room/day =  72
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> oh sure, we need the overall amount of possible sessions first
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:21:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so let's figure about 70 - that gives room for BoFs, Keynotes, Breaks, etc....
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:21:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we had 70 last year  right?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:22:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> last year we had 64 I believe, without BOFs
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> though many of the critical sessions were too short imo because we crammed so much into short time
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:22:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> or not completely without BOFs but lots of BOFs came in later
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> during the conf
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> we have 4 rooms + main room
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh.  thought 4 rooms included the main room.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:23:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Is the ballroom also available during the day for sessions?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so that's 6 rooms
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:23:41 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">whistles... we can do a lot with that!</span>
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> well, me counts 5
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:23:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 5 - ballroom = mainroom
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:23:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but I might be wrong ;-)
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:24:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> (sorry, I missed the time)
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:24:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> for today let's go with a target of 70 sessions.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:24:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   4 regular rooms, 1 main room, 1 ball room.  Right?  Or am I reading wrong?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> one moment
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> nice that you made it :-)
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   +1  although I request that we do not assume all sessions are just one hour.  Important to keep that flexibility open here
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> gents, micha is the suse labs man in the program committee
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:25:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Hi micha   Nice to meet you!
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:26:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> anything of interest discussed up to now?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:26:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> micha,   not really.  We're just trying to figure out actual room numbers  :-)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:26:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, we have:
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:26:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> the zentrifuge (main room)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:26:47 </span><span class="nka">* vuntz</span> <span class="ac">is grabbing food while everybody counts ;-)</span>
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> - two rooms with 95 squaremeters
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:27:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> - one room with 321 sm
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:27:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> - one room wiht 144 sm
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> that makes four seminar rooms and the main hall
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:27:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> while the one with 321 sm is fairly huge
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:28:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so that's 5 rooms
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:28:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I would propose: We plan the main room, the Ballsaal (with 321 sm) and the two 100 sm rooms for the regular schedule
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:29:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> that makes four stages
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:29:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ohhhh  I see
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:29:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and we use the 5th room for spontanous BOFs etc.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:29:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:29:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> four tracks in parallel is quite a lot anyway IMO
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:29:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> dont' we need the 5th room for a speaker room?
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:30:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   No  they'll use some other room  (a small room) or even the beergarden
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:30:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> also possible, but what is the speaker room for?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:30:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   A speaker room is used for speakers to relax, decompress, review their presentations and get away from the crowd
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> quite standard at most conferences
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:30:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, I see
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:31:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, I would second the idea to use the 5th one for that
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:31:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> what is your opinion on the number of tracks in parallel ?
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> according to the discussion in previous meeting, we can use a room other than these set rooms
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:31:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne proposed to use the beergarden area in the daytime for the speaker room
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:31:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> four tracks is much
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> last year we had three main tracks in parallel
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> I agree
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm thinking 4 track is to much
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tracks and rooms are not the same IMO
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:32:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> for the size of our audience
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:32:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we had MORE than 4 rooms last year, didn't we?    We used rooms in the other building
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> how many people do we expect to attend?
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok - 4 sessions at the same time is to many
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:32:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, so is that a decision that we will go for three tracks in parallel?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> vuntz,   500 expected, 45 registered so far  :-)
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> if we really expect 500, I don't think 4 is too much
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "too many" is relevant to how many expecting.
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:33:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> right vuntz
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so lets go for three.
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's plan 3 tracks plus BoFs
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">15:33:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but again, its quality, not quantity that counts.     Let's not have sessions just for the sake of sessions.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> with two tracks with talks and one with BoFs
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:33:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> This is RWX after all
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> oh ;_)
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:33:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> guys
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:34:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> funny ;-)
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:34:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're assuming stuff without a cursory glance at what we have thus far.      We're putting the cart before the horse here
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">15:34:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I don't really agree, but ok: Lets aim for three tracks, I think that is common ground
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:35:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok   + BoFs or including BoFs?
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:35:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> lets decide that when we have an idea how many good abstracts we have
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:35:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 dragotin; for today's purpose let's go with 3 tracks + a room for BoFs
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> good
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok - back to the original question
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">15:36:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> We have 91 submissions up to now, 22 BoFs, 15 workshop, rest Talks.
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> take off about 5 as there were duplicates
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:36:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> thats roughly 1.5 times as much as we had last year
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:37:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Also some were listed as "hacksessions"
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:37:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> 3 sessions a 4 days, let's say 7 1 hour slots per day, are 84 hour slots.
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:37:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and I haven't submitted my 12 yet ;-)
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> holy crap.  7 sessions in one day?    :-)
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:37:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> three before noon, four after.
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but please, lets stay with the agenda
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:38:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> lets discuss the voting process
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:38:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  you're right dragotin
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:38:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> That's hour slots, not necessarily sessions, as BoFs/workshops may quite possibly need longer.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:38:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> did somebody read my mail to cfp?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> about the process?
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:38:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> fwiw, with 50 talks and 22 BoFs, 3 rooms for talks &amp; 1 for BoFs sounds weird
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:38:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:38:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> can we agree on that?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:38:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> I think the process was sensible.
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:39:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> does anybody have questions about?
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> I thought we agreed on the process earlier in the meeting? :-)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:39:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I thought so too  :-)
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:39:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> yes, you thought ;-)
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:39:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, fine.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:39:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so we have the agenda item finished
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:39:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> Are the propose to accept/reject counted somewhere?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:39:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok let's move on to agenda item #2
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> well, at every abstract you see the list of who has proposed to accept/reject
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:40:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> in indico
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">15:40:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> wait pls
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">15:40:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> what is the timeline?
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">15:40:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> Yeah, I more though about in the overview list, so that one can quickly see how many rejects/accepts it had.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:41:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> when do we plan the meeting where we finally decide about which we accept/reject?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,    ok so for timeline, we are firm that CFP closes this weekend, correct?    We should complete first pass-through of voting by end of next week then
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:41:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> I am not sure honestly.
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:41:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> Okay, doesn't matter much.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">15:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> The CFP should close next monday, right?
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">15:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> after that, once we have gotten the rejections out of the way, then we need to determine number of slots truly available and decide which of the "likes" we can put in
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">15:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> end of next week: +1
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">15:42:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> +1 for end of next week for first round of votes
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">15:42:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that would make our finally decision meeting on monday, august 1st for example
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">15:42:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> In any case, end of next week (meaning Friday or Sunday?) seems sensible.
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">15:42:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> does that sound cool?
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">15:42:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So, if we work hard,  we can be done by Aug 5th
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">15:43:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so individual reviews are to be completed by July 29, next CFP meeting August 1st?
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">15:43:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   we should have a meeting on Aug 1 sure,  and hopefully we actually get done, but give us little room and assume unexpected with a hard finish by Aug 5th
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">15:43:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> +1
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:43:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:43:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so everybody on the committee has to do his indiv. voting by monday, august 1st
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">15:44:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> just that we're clear about that
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">15:44:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Right.  Earlier of course is better :)
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">15:44:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">15:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Can I get some clarification about SUSE Labs tracks?   Do we vote on those?  or does SUSE Labs get to decide their own track?
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">15:44:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> There is AFAIK no such thing like a Labs Track
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">15:44:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a large number of these sessions are led by SUSE Labs folks
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">15:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> We vote on all proposals based on their merit.
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">15:45:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   well that's what I want clarificaton on as past SUSE Labs was separate and private
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">15:45:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> We do need to reserve some session space for the Labs
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">15:45:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so this year SUSE Labs is wide open to the public.  Correct?
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">15:45:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Yeah, but not much.
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">15:45:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Yes.
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">15:45:55 </span><span class="nka">* dragotin</span> <span class="ac">hugs micha</span>
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">15:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> That's newsworthy and we should use that as an important promotion for marketing
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">15:46:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's make sure that those are entered into indigo - even if they are simply entered as place holders
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">15:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> absolutely
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">15:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> read - the sponsors brochure - in there we state that there are closed sessions
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">15:46:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Though, I'll say that if too many of the Labs talks are rejected I'd force you to accept a separate Labs track for all those that interest me :)
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">15:46:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> yes, I complained about that two weeks ago I think ;-)
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">15:47:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">15:47:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's discuss the SUSE Labs stuff on Aug 1 after we have done the first voting round
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">15:47:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I do not expect that we will come into the situation that we will reject too much labs tracks
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:47:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Me neither.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">15:47:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> that *could* happen but wont probably
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">15:48:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, so bottomline:
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:48:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   shouldn't we be asking micha for a bribe first before making such implied promises?  :-)
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:48:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> everybody does his voting by august 1st
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:48:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> And I agree about discussing the setup of the labs talks once we've decided about acceptance and we are going to setup the schedule.
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:48:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I mean, we will surely end up with tracks called Kernel, basesystem whatever, that is Labs
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">15:49:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Generally I want to see them just included in the regular programme, not into some labs track.  We might have to reserve some slots for labs-only stuff, but I don't think the proposals submitted until now would be included therein.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">15:49:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> And, AlanClark, if Labs people need private space to discuss something, we could use the 5th room as well
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">15:49:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> guys, we've got to move on, I'm running out of time
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">15:49:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">15:50:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> just one quick question about the review process (after a test)
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">15:50:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> next agenda item?
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">15:50:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> when I click "propose to accept", I can choose a track; do we care about that?
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">15:50:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> if yes, what to do when there is no track in the combo box?
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">15:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, tracks are important
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">15:50:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> than we have to add these
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">15:50:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> it seems we can only choose tracks that were suggested by the speaker
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:51:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> hmm, haven't investigated into that enough yet
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:51:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> ok, let's look at that after the meeting
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> lets try to sort that offline, ok?
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:52:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> 2. Identify where we still have some holes in CFPs
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:52:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Ok - the action item for all cfp members is to review all the proposed sessions by August 1; marking each with a proposed accept or proposed reject"
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:52:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I still feel we can not do 2. now properly
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:52:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I don't propose that we we try to tackle that today
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:52:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> simply make an action that we begin to propose
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">15:53:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ideas over mail
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">15:53:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and I feel, given that its not much time any more and we have &gt;90 abstract, we simply DO NOT have wholes
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">15:53:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, or ideas on the cfp list.
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">15:53:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> please refer to my email about thoughts on what we are missing so we can go ahead offline and ping people to propose those topics before the deadline
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">15:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">15:53:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok

<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">15:53:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we do have holes, but again, look at my email offline to think about it.  Doesn't need to be discussed here and now

<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">15:55:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think that we should go with those 4

<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:56:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there will be journalists there and they are there to find out what's awesome about openSUSE.     So one keynote needs to cover openSUSE
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:57:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> an opening session with reflection fo the openSUSE community and introduction of the Labs and the new combined conference
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> for example
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:57:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  that's exactly what I am thinking
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">15:57:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I like the idea of an opening session
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">15:58:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Should we ask Jos to lead this one?
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">15:59:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> +1 for asking him to do it together with a Labs guy
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">15:59:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> can't hurt, yes.
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:00:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> quick question.    will Labs topics also be covered in Michael Miller's keynote?   Or is there enough material that theere won't be overlap?
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">16:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> +1 (but I'd like the session to talk about what's after 12.1 too, so that it's of interest to more people :-))
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">16:00:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> (I'll note that I find four keynotes a bit over-the-top, though)
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">16:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I'm not sure we need a keynote on the first day if we have an opening session
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">16:00:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, thats true
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">16:00:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think for is fine if we keep them to 30 minutes
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">16:00:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> for=4
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">16:01:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I consider opening session and keynote to be same in my book for the purposes of this discussion
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">16:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> Okay, that sounds reasonable.  I just don't want to "waste" four hours overall for pseudo-blah :)
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">16:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Also, will we want a lightning talk at the end?
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">16:01:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> submit it to Indico
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">16:01:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   do we want it?    Some find it useful, others don't.
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">16:02:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> will come out through the voting, right?
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">16:02:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> We'll have to reserve a few slots with unknown topics anyway.  I.e. those that come up during the conference, and could result in lightning talks.
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">16:02:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> micha,   yes
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">16:02:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">micha:</span> right
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">16:03:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, that was keynotes
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">16:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Flexibility is very important for our RWX theme
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">16:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> something to add?
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">16:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> that's enough for today
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">16:03:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Who will ping Jos for his keynote?   Want me to do it?
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">16:03:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> suseROCKS I'll do it
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">16:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> sure, cool
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">16:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> also cool
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">16:03:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">16:03:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> actually - you and I will see him at the same time ;-)
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">16:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's what I was thinking  :-)
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">16:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> what are you guys doing?
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">16:04:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> going to CLS
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">16:04:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   we're having a retreat in Tahiti
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">16:05:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> oh - I thought it was hawaii
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:05:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, last Agenda item is BOFs
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">16:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> do we want to handle that now?
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">16:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> what is it about?
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">16:05:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I put this on the list from the last meeting. I don't think we need to handle it now
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">16:05:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let's save this for next meeting
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">16:05:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">16:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   last meeting was concerned with how we'll manage and advertise BoFs etc.
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">16:05:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;micha&gt;</span> which is when?  1st Aug?
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Frankly I think we're missing a bunch of BoF opportunities, like team meetings.
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:06:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I'd say so, yes, 1st August
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:06:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But if we remain flexible, we can allow many BoFs to be created onsite at the conference
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, BOFs always have to be possible
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">16:06:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> e.g. team meeting BoFs are more likely to happen once people see who's actually present
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">16:06:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> A question though - should we  come prepared at the next meeting with a draft layout of the program?  Would that help expidite the meeting?
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">16:06:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> yes, probably
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">16:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> dragotin - does indigo help us draft a layout?
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">16:07:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   meaning a map of the slots?
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">16:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I volunteer to send a concrete proposal of the layout to the list beforehand
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">16:07:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> draft with specific talks allocated a specific time?
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">16:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> or draft as "schedule will look like that"?
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">16:07:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I vote for the latter.   Makes it easier for us to fill in the blanks
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">16:07:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">16:08:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I'll prepare that, ok?
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">16:08:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> cool
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">16:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Thanks dragotin
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">16:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 dragotin

<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">16:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> that was a productive one I think

<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">16:08:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Very quick indeed  :-)
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">16:08:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> izabel also was quickly now ;-)
