<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Moin everyone in IRC-Land.  Welcome to the 2013 Board Candidates Open Q&amp;A Debate.  first a few things to mention and then we'll continue
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> digitltom (thomas Schmidt) and suseROCKs (Bryen Yunashko) are today's moderators.  Our role is simply to ensure effective flow of discussion and make sure that things are handled in a positive fashion.
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:03:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We'd like to thank all the candidates for the effort to be here today.  it wasn't easy to plan at the last moment and with 8 candidates, scheduling is a challenge.
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:03:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But, while some candidates will be late and some candidates will have to leave a bit early, at least all candidates will be here at some point during the  next two hours.
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> You can read all of the candidates' platform and blogs to get familiarized with the candidates.  Let's keep the ball rolling by going directly to questions.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:04:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> How questions will be asked.   People can ask a main question , and the moderators will put it into /topic.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:05:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Once the question is in /topic, the candidates will begin answering that question.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:05:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Now...  I'd like to ask those candidates who are here to identify themselves both by Nick and Real Name so we all know who's present.

<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Awesome all 8 candidates appear to be here.  Thank you candidates for your effort.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> digitltom,   before we begin, do you have anything to add?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> no ;-)
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so, let's jump right into questions.   I see no early submission of questions, so who here has a question to get the ball rolling?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:09:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> me me me
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:09:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> Can Candidates ask questions?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,  state your question
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> 1. I see some proposals for better communication within the community. What are some specific ideas that you have to improve this aspect?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:10:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> Work reports from the board sent out regularly to the appropriate lists would be a first start IMO
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> The second thing I believe is encourage the community to ask questions to the Board..
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:12:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> from my point of view if the candidate is well involved in the community already and has a good understanding of user needs, this will help
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:12:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> I don't have that proposal on my list :-)
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I think we should should social media as a means to get the message out. With google translate, there should not be any excuse to translate any reports, messages so that everyone gets what the board is doing. I also believe board should have an open door when it comes to the community so that the community feel we are here for them.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> We have some teams in the project who are doing a great job at communicating, both among themselves and between each other - the growing amount of chatter between the GNOME and KDE teams in particular
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:13:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> ...but as an opensuse-factory reader/writer, I'm participating in communication with a vital part of the community: the developers.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:13:28 </span><span class="nka">* znggo</span> <span class="ac">would oppose Google Translate being used for any board communication</span>
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:13:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> This has many aspects, thus we need to have multiple solutions. There is no general answer. - The board needs to communicate better, we need to figure out how to improve cross linking of teams, i.e. developers/packagers with marketing/art-work with forums.....
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> We aren't using a lot tools that could get our messages out to all the members, I like to see openSUSE News come back like when Mann ran it with PDF a coloum from the boards one what we are working on.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:14:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'd like to see more of that kind of open, collaborative communication, and that also means from the board - I like suggestions like Matt's, people need to know what the board is upto, just as other contributors need to know what is going on in their parts of the project
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I believe that it is not only the communication to and from the board itself. It is also the communication within the community and with SUSE itself. One improvement could be Newsletters from the Board about topics discussed,
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:14:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> *In my dealings with the board as a forum admin, I have found them to be quite in touch with the community and they certainly worked well with us in the forum team to establish some good ground rules in the forum
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:15:08 </span><span class="nka">* anditosan</span> <span class="ac">these specifics are interesting</span>
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Does anyone have a followup question to this topic?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">caf4926:</span> Can you correct me if I am wrong.. I had an experience last year I would like to discuss it too
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I have seen in the past the board seem to be a bit distant from the community that a lot stuff was only community in the irc channel. We need to be able to take what is spoke here and it out to the community.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> not sure I understand your question
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:16:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The communication issue probably needs to be an explicit topic for board/project meetings for a while and then we need to divide and conquer the various aspects. This is a very braod topic
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I am interested in knowing what can be done at a team level rather than from the board to the community. Working within the rest of the community to improve their communication is important to me
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> what do you propose to be done among teams to work on communication?
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:16:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> Is that something the board can actually change?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:17:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> After all, if people don't want to talk to each other, they won't talk to each other :-)
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:17:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> what do you think? Should it,? can it?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> between different teams or the same... if it is different teams, the teams should move forward and seek help when necessary.. like the news team will need the marketing team and the gnome team needs artwork for their wallpapers and themes.. somebody will have to step up
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think the board can suggest a path of communication, i.e. one spokesperson for each of the various teams, this spokes person send announcements/progress/work reports to the announce list for example
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:18:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> I have a question, how can I submit it ? :)
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I believe that the board can facilitate communication on team level. Most of the things that disrupts communication is that one team doesn't know what the other team is doing. By providing a communication platform (Maybe even Social Media, openSUSE News, etc), this could be improved. I have seen this between Gnome and KDE teams. Once you identify common goals, communication will follow
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I think it should be within the capabilities of the board to encourage and hopefully foster better communication within teams. We've got good examples like the desktop teams, it might be the place of the board to nudge teams to follow similar practices if teams are struggling to have the same degree of communication
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   as soon as this topic is done, we'll ask you what your question is and enter it into the topic.   Shold be ust a few minutes.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:20:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> *just
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:20:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> anditosan, if you are asking how the board could help to teams communication. Maybe if there are issue of communication problem, the board could help in team meeting, help be a bridge to make sure every can speak.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:20:14 </span><span class="nka">* nmarques</span> <span class="ac">grins evilly</span>
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:20:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> *all of us here are well involved but a huge number of users that are new to the LinuxLand, not necessarilly opensuse members, just don't really know about the communication we have (irc, ML), I meet many who don't even know what irc is and couldn't even set it up. Maybe we need a better news front, that could include a news letter from the board and it's doings..
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:21:23 </span><span class="nka">* anditosan</span> <span class="ac">analyzes</span>
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> I don't think the board can force anyone (or any team) to do anything.  Encourage co-operation between teams, sure, but at a certain point it's all volunteers.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:21:42 </span><span class="nka">* seife</span> <span class="ac">also had trouble setting up irc, especially the dark colors of xchat drove me nuts</span>
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:21:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I think we can note this as an idea.. the board reports to the community.. most of us have a consensus
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:21:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> many good answers to this topic.  Any more answers before we move on to next topic?
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> anditosan, I remember when suseROCKs, yaloki  were on the board, the helped mediate a lot of team meetings. I am will to do that.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> aha
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> :D

<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:23:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> nmarques, has a question
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:23:44 </span><span class="nka">* nmarques</span> <span class="ac">grins evilly</span>
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span>  what's your question?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> The world changes and the community demands that the Board becomes objective oriented; In such scenario what would propose to youselves as your objectives and what metrics should the community member use to diagnose/evaluate your performance towards achieving the very own objectives suggested by yourselves ?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> My objectives, like probably everyone elses, would be to a) Push forward a mentorship program and b) Open better communication channels.  The metrics would be: a) Did the mentorship program get off the ground? [Y/N] b) Are people happier with the communication from the board? [Y/N]
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> <span class="hi">obviously:</span> someone has to define the objectives, and the board needs to report on the fulfillment.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> The question is, if being a board member is something that's attractive in such an environment.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> seife, so in other words... there's no initiative required for board members ? :)
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:28:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> My Objectives : Report quarterly, that should become a norm ; and transparency in cash dealings or a set up where we can work on cashes with SUSE / other sponsors so
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> One objective is to establish objectives ;) From my point of view there are none today. Even in a volunteer "organization" I believe in accountability, from everyone not just the board. The board needs to agree on what is needed, then make it a priority, publicize it and work on it to conclusion. May this be a mentor program financial transparency or other topic.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> it's a community, the objectives are driven by the community, the board needs to be listening and have good coms to best understand and interpret such
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> caf4926, Sirko's expulsion was a fine example of the Board listening to the people (behind closed doors, and thats for you AlanClark)
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I want to see the Foundation get set up finial it been talked about 4 years. I think once we do that then we can work setting up education programs for new users. Setting up better ambassador project.   Listening to the community on what works, that that feed back improve on it and share it.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:29:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> well, the answer to the question is: the board needs to report on the fulfillment of the objectives. The judgement if they are met or not is onto the reader of that report.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:29:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> one thing I'd like to bring to the community is the idea of defining a 'Goal' for the Project, possibly defining a target audience/use case for the distribution. the metrics for that would be, does the community agree with the need for a goal, and if so, does it select one?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> if I would vote, my vote would be for manugupt1 :)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:30:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> thanks all for the kind answers, I already know what I wanted to know :)
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:30:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> good luck all, and may the best win
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> As the other candidates already indicate it that the main objectives are driven by the community. However the board elections provides already some objectives where the community can indicate whether or not they are important. Each candidate has it's own goals/objectives of what he wants to establish when he would be elected. Based on the voting we should have quite a good picture of which goals/objectives are important for
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> clearly such actions have to be taken for a reason and should be done under established protocol/rules and with a team agreement
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:31:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> the community itself. The board should confirm them and report on them
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> we have SUSE Studio, OSB, and Google Summer of Code. All of which we have worked hard one.  I like to see getting more things out.
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> nmarques, that was two years ago. And there was a lot more going one. And it wasn't just AlanClark, it was the whole board. I remeber I was there when a lot of attacks happen.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:33:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> lupinstein, jump to next topic :)
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:33:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> I already know who has goals defined and who didn't had any ;)

<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ok   does anyone have a new question to ask the candidates?
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The board needs to be more than a "reportor/monitor". It is important to keep the hands on the pulse of the community, no question. But some things just need to be initiated by the board and then set free. Board needs to actively call for volunteers for certain intiatives.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:34:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> \me hands up?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> yes, I have a question
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> s/reportor/reporter/
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:34:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> +1 robjo
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:34:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> The board has a very difficult issue. I think it would be best not to drag that up, since a lot of people probably don't know everything. I think we need to move on. Focus on what the board can do to better the community as a whole
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:35:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   State your question please.
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:35:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> Dear candidates, any proposal to improve ambassadors program?
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:36:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> There was a talk at osc12 concerning the revamped program, is this not sufficient?
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:36:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> I don't know enough about the program to answer
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:36:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> im not a board member but i suggest to watch kostas talk from osc12
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:36:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> Certainly, warlordfff and others (including myself) have already been working on the Ambassador programme 2.0 - there was a good presentation about it at the openSUSE conference
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> What are the detailed issues you have with the program?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:36:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> I'll be honest: I don't know much about the ambassador program, so I don't have an opinion on it.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> well, I already seen the wonderfull presentation b the kostas at conference, my point is not related with one specific subject, but in general
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:37:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> Yes.. and I believe Richard, Kostas, and Izabel to give their best. Also, recently Agustin seriously indicated a revamped ambassador program,
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, you know I have a very special place for the ambassador program. I love us to give the tools they need. Right, I am sad to see we haven't announce any new ambassador as we have in the past. I like to see the ambassador 2.0 place out so that everyone can read it and give feed back on it.
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:38:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So yes there will be improvements :)
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">15:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I believe the ambassadors program is a key program to reach the communicatin improvement to the community, because this ambassadors program appear in my head
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:38:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm not sure I understand the question then. There's already a community effort to improve the ambassador program, it's underway, I don't see why it would need the involvement of the board at this stage, unless theres some problems I'm not aware of?
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ok, thanks all for the answers
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> any more responses to this question?  If not, I'll turn the floor over to digitltom to handle the next question
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:39:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> if there are any problems that crop up implementing ambassadors 2.0, heck yeah I plan to help out and get that programme running, but I'll be doing that whether or not I'm elected to the board ;-)
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The ambassador program is very important, I think everyone will agree with that and will certainly get the support from the board and any newly elected member. However, suggesting improvements to a new program (2.0) that has not really seen much light of day yet is a bit pre-mature.
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:40:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, lovelly is this the right answer I like to see, perfect in my humble opinion
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">15:40:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I like to see us create more pdf like how to install openSUSE, that the ambassador can print out and give to people a long with the DVD that they pass out. I like to see the ambassador become or like teachers so that when they go out they can educate everyone on all the products we have to offer, how to get more people to get into community.  I think if we have our own pdf magazine that would be a big plus for
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:40:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> everyone.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> so, who has another question?
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:41:18 </span><span class="nka">* tux93</span> <span class="ac">raises hand</span>
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:41:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span>  go on please
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> The ambassadors our salemen for the community and the more tools and support we give them, the better we look
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> CarlosRibeiro: What I believe is this programme should start off as soon as possible.. We can always shape the imperfections..
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">15:41:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> my question is about the foundatin: some, not all, of the candidates have posted their plans for it on their plattform, so what are your plans to finally get it started?
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:41:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> manugupt1, +1
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:42:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> It would be really great to have a foundation, but I didn't mention it in my platform because I don't know enough about the problems that have been encountered so far in setting one up
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:43:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> a lot has changed in the last few years, SUSE's status as a company, SUSE's relationship with the project. A few years ago there were a lot of frictions which led me to believing we needed a Foundation to exert the independance I felt we were lacking at the time
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:43:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> is there a consensus that a foundation is wanted / needed? I have skimmed some of the discussions over the last years, but I don't seem to remember that there was an outcome?
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:43:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> <span class="hi">seife:</span> +1
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:44:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> One, I haven't seen or heard were we stand on Foundation. So I like to work with SUSE and see if can push to get started. I really think if we have the foundation it would help community over all.  I think that now SUSE is back as it own. That we will have the support and can move forward, but we need to see what work as been done. Pick up and move forward.
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:44:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> but time has moved on, things have changed, I think SUSE do a much better job of being a sponsor while giving us the room to be our own, independent, Project. If the community still wants one, I'll support it, but I personally would prefer tackling just any 'pain points' which remain
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:44:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> such as the concerns about money, receiving donations, etc - all of which I believe could have solutions that do not require a full foundation
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:44:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">seife:</span> for finances, i can see it being useful.  Not having to rely on a company to handle the bookkeeping and legal aspect would be a huge positive
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I agree with seife that the bigger question is if a foundation is still wanted / needed.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> *too many balls in the air?... whatever the community drives for must have a solid objective and reason, don't just do it for doing it sake
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:45:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The idea of a foundation was born at a completely different time of the openSUSE project. Since the idea was born many changes have occurred at SUSE. I think the idea of a foundation is stuck in peoples head and while it was needed at the time the idea was born I am not certain this is still the case today. Further I am not certain that anyone, or collectively, we have taken stock an re-evaluated whether or not the founda
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:45:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;caf4926&gt;</span> *or just do it because we like the sound of it..
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:45:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span> To really answer these questions I feel we need to ask ourselves a few questions.. What are the tasks related to it? Like Finances, More transparency, More paper work, More independence, More sponsors.. The second question is are we ready to have a foundation? I believe no, If you ask why
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:45:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, if we had the foundation we could help the project by getting funds to help the many different teams. That was talk that the foundation would be great for that.
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seife&gt;</span> <span class="hi">caf4926:</span> +1
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:46:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Then my answer would be we never took the trouble to get independent while SUSE was with us.. so now I believe we should work on the smaller bits and maybe in the next 6 months or so we will be ready
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:47:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> smaller bits includes reporting and maintaining small amounts of case. etc.. That would be my answer tittiatcoke
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> that might be so, but I'm not convinced we couldn't do that anyway. I would rather investigate options like the Software Freedom Conservancy, rather than push for a full foundation which would have significantly higher administrative burden
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:47:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span>  .. sorry
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> ok, thanks for your answers, shedding some light
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:49:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Anyone with a new question?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:49:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> maybe I am wrong, but if we had a foundation we could get money from the sell of things to help fund us
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:49:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or do candidates wish to continue on this topic for a few more minutes?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I dont think you are wrong, but I think there could be other ways to achieve that same goal
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:50:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> that's possible without a foundation, the complicated part is how to handle the tax accounting
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I also think many in the community are a bit naive about what it means to be a foundation. We are not going to get sponsors beating down our doors just because we are a foundation, to name just one example. Fund raising is hard work and requires dedicated people.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">15:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> without it, the money would go to SUSE like the money from Google Summer of Code, but I could be wrong.

<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:50:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> if the money goes to SUSE, and SUSE then use that money for what openSUSE want to use it for, where is the problem?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:50:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> question anyone?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:50:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> Last time heard, Jos telling in a mailing list that we do get money.. so thats great..  :) but we need some transparency there.. I believe.. which should be a role for the next board
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> Well when I talked with AlanClark, but this was when Novell was still in charge, he told me hard to get funds directly to openSUSE
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">15:51:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> with the Foundation it would be,

<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">15:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I think we need it before the foundation

<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">15:52:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> it would be hard for me to give to SUSE, because I am not sure if it would all go to openSUSE.

<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:53:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's revisit the foundation question again soon as there's lots of good discussion here.   vuntz   what's your question?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:53:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Agreed.. and that is why I say.. Foundation can be a consequence once we handle the more important issues at hand
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">15:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> since the board work can take some time, do you think this will have some impact on your other openSUSE contributions? Are there people to back you up for those contributions?

<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">15:54:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> robjo, if it was a foundation like znggo state, a good tax right off for donations.

<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">16:04:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> digitltom,   whenever you're ready to re-start  :-)
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">16:04:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;digitltom&gt;</span> so, who has the next question?
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">16:06:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> *yawn*
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">16:06:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> we have talked about community, but how to the other candidates feel about losing a lot of member to open-slx?
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">16:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,    surely you have lots of questions.  You always have good questions to ask  :-)
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">16:07:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I'd argue whether or not we've lost a 'lot of members' to open-slx - all of their websites community links point back to openSUSE community pages
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">16:07:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I didn't pay attention so I disqualified myself
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">16:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I think it's nice that we make such a good distribution that they chose to make a derivative of it, and I'm pretty sure most of their contributors are still, directly and indirectly, contributing to 'our' project
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">16:08:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Loosing contributors/members is not a good thing, but also inevitable, people move on to other things for whatever reason. I was not aware that there was a particular problem with open-slx.
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">16:08:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> i thought open-slx was a SLES clone?
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">16:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> s/clone/derivative/
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">16:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> anyway, people should choose the distro that best fits them, and if open-slx is better for someone, more power to them
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">16:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> The KDE area didn't loose any members to open-slx, but the loss was more due to the reorganization of the boosters team
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">16:09:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> lupinstein,   perhaps you can expand on what you mean by losing members and the issues with open-slx as seems people aren't fully aware of htis.
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">16:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> *this
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">16:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> well from what I heard, open-slx is taking the work of openSUSE and selling their box edition base on it.
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">16:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> we lost S. Mann to them, our new editor for years
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">16:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> We have lost a few others. I know at one point Novell was were that they were trying to set up a new SUSE.
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">16:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Taking openSUSE and building a product on top of it is a great compliment to our work, we should be happy about that. There will always be people that leave the project and move on.
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">16:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree with robjo
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">16:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> we're an open source project - as long as they're not breaching GPL or other licenses, isn't that 'take our stuff and make it better' actually something we quite like? Heck, SUSE have Studio which makes thousands upon thousands of openSUSE derivatives
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">16:13:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I been wiry about open-slx, I hate us to lose good people. I hate to see the work being taking with out them giving something back to us.
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">16:13:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> The first distro I worked for recompiled RedHat packages.  SUSE started out similarly.  I can't complain at all about open-slx.
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">16:13:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> true but they give back
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">16:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I haven't seen open-slx give anything back, maybe I am wrong
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">16:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Stephan used to work for SUSE, so have others. Some choose to stay involved in openSUSE, other choose not to. I am not certain there is much we can do as a board. Now if there is a "mass exodus" we have to look at the situation but having a handful of people leave is not what I would consider a "mass exodus"
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">16:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> +1  However we should have a look how this impacts the divers teams within the openSUSE project. It could be that if all of them were working in a particular area, that could create issues in that area. But in general you can not prevent people from switching distro nor community
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">16:16:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I know people are going to copy left, but it would be great to see them give back. Even it is just a little here and there.   I know the board can't control it.
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">16:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> Yes, if a significant number of people from one team leave it is certainly something that needs attention.
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">16:17:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I remember how before there was a SUSE that the guys were helping out Slackware, because of the work they did, knew they could do a better job and created SUSE. BUt for a while you can see them giving back to Slackware.
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">16:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> the open-slx forums have 58 registered users, I'm sure one or two of them is bound to have contributed something back to openSUSE at some point, and if that hunch is correct that's actually a pretty good rate of return
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">16:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> anyway, next question I just want to see where every one stood on open-slx.
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">16:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I don't think this is really within the scope of the Q&amp;A :-)
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">16:18:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Also, I can still see packages from sascha.. :)
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">16:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok    we've covered so much   awesome.   Does anyone have a new question?  If not, we can revisit the Foundations question if the candidates feel they need more time on that one.
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">16:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am not certain revisiting the foundation question will lead to further information.
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">16:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> IMHO it is pretty obvious where candidates stand w.r.t. the foundation.
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">16:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">note:</span>  I'm not encouraging its revisit.  I merely promised the opportunity when I interjected earlier to get a new question out so seife could answer one more question before leaving  :-)
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">16:21:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We can continue to argue over the merits but that is probably not helpful in this context of the discussion
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">16:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> However, if there are no new questions or revisits, we can move on to closing the debate.
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">16:22:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Do the candidates themselves have questions or statements they wish to make in closing?
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">16:22:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> This has been a great debate, thank you Bryen, Tom, and the election team for helping put it all together, and organising a great election so far

<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">16:26:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> to me we're at a point where the _project_ needs to find what it wants its board for
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">16:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> not the opposite :)
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">16:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> znggo,    Hehe.  I agree.   I wanted to get a seeing eye dog so I could drive, but humane society said it was not a good idea to have my dog run alongside my car on the highway.
