<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">18:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Alrighty folks, a quick explanation before we go on with the actual agenda...
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">18:09:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Today is a kickoff meeting, and we want to be as inclusive as possible.   So we will ensure to record everything and make sure it is seen elsewhere
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I will blog regularly about our progress
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and keep our wiki page updated as well as send messages to the -project ML
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We will not entirely work on IRC, but as is traditional, for all of our openSUSE Conference plannings, we start off with an IRC Kickoff meeting
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> any questions before we proceed?
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Very well then,  here is our agenda: http://en.opensuse.org/SUSECon_Planning#Feb_1.2C_Kick_off_meeting_agenda
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 1.  Define the target audience for this event
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 2.  We need to name this event
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 3.  Breaking down the planning:  What needs to be planned
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 4.  Call for Volunteers
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and on to first topic!
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic  </span><span class="topicline">Define the target audience for this event</span>
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:13:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> who wants to express their thoughts about this?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> druonysus?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> well I think we should target not only people but also anyone who is interested in openSUSE
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:14:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> I favor a wide focus, at least the current users.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I believe this must follow the strategy focus  for target users, http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy#Target_users
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Maybe investigate what LUGs there are in the area as well
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so is our target audience those who are already using openSUSE in some form?  Or do we want to reach out to people beyond openSUSE?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Hi CarlosRibeiro
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ;)
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well let me point out that the focus (theme) of the openSUSE Conference last time was "RWX"
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 on CarlosRibeiro for target users.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">workingwriter_:</span>  I don't think we should leave out cuttent user... keep in mind that is is a good opertunity to have people in the US come and see openSUSE and the community around the project
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Which meant people were there to talk, write and do it.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> goos point, but how will we get this informations from lug? any idea
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, I can find out!
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:16:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> a kind of a quickly survey?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Should we have half talks and half how-tos?    Do we want to have hackfests?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think osc is a better target for deep technical discussions, perhaps we focus this on target users?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Agreed,  I think  talks/howtos will be more effective in US
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:17:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> We should not exclude anyone, but focus efforts on who we have.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> I think a hackfest of sorts would be cool
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:18:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we could also have beginners sessions for people to know how to get involved in the projec
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,   sure
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> I think a beginners track might be nice.  A way to draw in new linux users
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:18:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span>  I agree with you, spcially because openSUSE in not such well know for the general ppl in US, and only few techs over there could be named as tech opensuse/suse guys
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:18:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> I like that idead
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sshaw,   do you think we can get enough folks to create a meaningful hackfest?   (keeping in mind this is only a weekend-event)
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:18:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> not sure
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:19:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> maybe not a hackfest in the traditional sense
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> what about a particular project, something directed?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:19:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> +1 for beginners track, "lizards gets hands dirty sessions"
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:19:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> maybe a developer hangout corner that is fully stocked with all the latest in caffeine products and snackes?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> snacks
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Note that because of the flexibility of hackfests, we don't have to actually SAY there will be "x" hackfest.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> that sounds good... and I think we could pull off something like that and the "lizards gets hands dirty sessions"
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We didn't really do that for oSC either.   Whatever hackfests happeened during the conference were pretty much ad hoc
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> YesAbsolutely have a beginners track.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> begginers sessions also could be recorded and published at blip.tv channel
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:22:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I think we have a general consensus (which we should also present to the mailing list for any thought) that we will focus mainly on talks and howtos  with some beginner level stuff
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRIbeiro +1
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:22:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> YES
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   Sure, but that's really a separate topic  related to venue planning itself
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:23:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> another suggestion is to have a quickly workshop about whot to migrate from windows to openSUSE, http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:How_to_migrate_from_Windows
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Hold on folks...
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:23:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> specific session talks really go into CFP proposals.    We're talking about target audience now.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:24:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Qchmqs&gt;</span> do you know any
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   its a great idea,  for sure.  I like it a lot.  Just we only have about an hour meeting time and we need to stay on track for kickoff focus
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:24:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ok, keep going
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:24:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Qchmqs&gt;</span> good online todo list
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:24:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> if we wanted to pull in more hackers, we could invite other .orgs to hold their hackfest as part of our event = I'm not a fan of this idea but throw it out for discussion
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I like this idea, of course every idea and actions could have pros and cons, but I really like the ideo to have ppl from apache, gimp, inkscape, bender, around us
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I think its always good to try and build our developer community.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:26:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> An interesting concept.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:26:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> maybe even have a developer track making developers part of the focus group
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:26:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> The reason I'm not a fan of the idea is that it can easily become a distraction more than a benefit
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> does anyone think we could pull off a kind of showcase for people doing interesting things with openSUSE... show how versitile it is? -- think exhibit hall kind of thing but all openSUSE deminstartions?... just want to get other peoples feel for something like that?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> well if there are specific areas that openSUSE needs help with, we can put that as a subject of this hackfest
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I have an idea in mind for a session or workshop or talk
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:27:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> which brings us back to our original question of "target audience"   Are we using this event to "spread the word of openSUSE"  or is this more an "internal" event to work within our own community of users and developers?
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:27:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> SUSE has some really cool tool for developers
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> suseROCKS - you're asking the right question
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:27:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> yes, but if we already know problem is time to think in a kind of workaorund to no let get distracted, instead of let they out of the game, i think
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> We could also invite FLOSS-Manuals folk to have a booksprint.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> it has a lot of really good tools for everyone... and some things people just really dont know about (something we could aim to fix in the beginners track)
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:28:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> so in summary, our target audience as of right now is people who are interested in openSUSE, do particular openSUSE projects, and developers who could code for openSUSE during our sessions?
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> druonysus,   sure, but at the same time, it could be argued that we should use the time to educate our own community about our strengths and then subsequently they preach the goodness in their home areas.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Whereas if we are spending a lot of time working with "outsiders"  what cost do we end up neglecting our own folks?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I see the point
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:29:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Can we strike a good balance?   That's the question.  Especially in the limited weekend time frame
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:30:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> two groups
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Remember, this isn't really meant to be like a trade show (like SCaLE or similar)
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:30:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we could identify then working from the inside out, first encourage our members and then move outwards
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:30:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> agree with anditosan summary
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:30:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> brilhant path
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:31:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,   isn't that what my point was earlier?  :-)    We focus on ourselves first and then when they go home they preach in their communities
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRIbeiro, maybe indetifying members of our community who could make it.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:31:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we think alike hehehe yes
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:32:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so I'm going to summarize the questions we have raised here and put it to the List, so we can move on to next topic
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, my question would be how do we work on communicating and encouraging our own members to attend?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> suseROCKs as soon everyone inside are at the same page and with same directoins, time to go out
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> why dont you guys create 2 groups, one for opensuse folks and one for newcomers ? :)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:33:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   Exactly
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Creatura85,   I'll include that in the question too.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:33:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so let's move on to naming
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:33:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic  </span><span class="topicline">We need to name the event!</span>
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:34:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If you all look at the agenda, you'll notice that there are several names proposed for this event
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> quickly link for theses names, please
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> i dont think that the day when openSUSE comes to my home country for a conference is that close :P
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I really like the one druonysus proposed but with a slight modiication:  openSUSE Huddle - North America
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> sorry I've found
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:35:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Question is would people understand the significance of "huddle"?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:35:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I like that Huddle idea... but then again, I would.

<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> that was an e.g of the word "summit" used in a different context
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:40:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> well, I personally do not like summit, because a few other projects use it for their events as well
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:40:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Carlos is right - Camp and Huddle make it hard to get sponsors and companies support

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:41:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRobeiro, maybe put it to a vote. Im not sure if it really sticks with people
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:41:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> but I still believing that will be easier for my boss understand to pay my trip to a summit than for  camp
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Summit does lend to the "regionality" of the event rather than stealing confusion from Conference itself.   It has a good potential and easily understandable
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:41:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I don't think it that woudl be true... I mean maybe camp but if you people know what a huddle is... but I do supose you would know better than I would on that
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:42:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Huddle has a very homey - we're a family! feel to it.   But, could be off-putting to someone who uses openSUSE but doesn't feel like they're part of the community yet
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:43:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Personally, I *love* Huddle, but I can see its drawbacks
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:43:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well that is fixed by marketing

<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we have to market it as "come be part of our huddle"

<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">18:57:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> go Spanish, go!
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">18:57:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'd like to propose we make an effort to have a bi-lingual conference  so that Spanish supporters feel welcome too.
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">18:57:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;workingwriter_&gt;</span> Si
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">18:57:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We have several Spanish speakers already here in the meeting, I think we can do it.
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">18:58:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Thoughts?
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">18:58:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> just laughing about myself... openSUSE UFC - openSUSE Unique Forum and Conf = openSUSE UFC
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">18:58:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1, but we need to be clear - no simultanious translation - to expensive
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">18:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I like the idea. I think it would be good (later) to decide what type of sessions should also be hosted in Spanish, or if we would like to use translation equipment
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">18:58:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   No futbol talk.  We are not Corinthians!
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">18:58:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I doubt many ppl will not stop and ready the article just because have UFC in the event name :D
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">18:59:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> Ultimate Fighting Championship® (UFC) ?
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">18:59:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">18:59:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">18:59:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> come watch the lizards duke it out
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">18:59:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> sshaw, we hispanics are always in a fight for some reason
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">18:59:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so do we generally agree we want to go bi-lingual or only one official language?
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">18:59:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> yeap, but in pur case, openSUSE Ultimate Forum and Conference
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">18:59:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I like the official language take
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">18:59:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> one other point - are we capable of building a bilingual program?
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;druonysus&gt;</span> but I don't speak spanish
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:00:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   Anditosan, tian and itxshell are spanish speakers who are very interested in attending.   And hopefully Federico will be there for SUSECon.
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:00:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> bi-lingual is good, but if we are spending the entirely day to find a simple name in one lnaguage, oh my gosh, we will take forever to bet a bi-language name
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:00:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm thinking of the tools aka indico
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> AlanClark, we can make translated marketing materials, but we need to decide, after making sessions, which ones should be also in spanish
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:00:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're capable of having sessions in Spanish.  Are we capable of having translation devices?  probably not.
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:01:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> what if we just provide translation services
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:01:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> +1
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sshaw,   translation services require funding,  equipment + interpreters
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">19:01:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> it would suck if there are sessions you'd love to attend, but its not in your language
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">19:01:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> simultainious translation is very expensive
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">19:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we have spanish speakers in here
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">19:02:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> subtitles ;)
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">19:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sshaw,  but would it be fair to tax them to have to be translating every session instead of being a participant?
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">19:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> then I will be able to subscribe for a talk and no one will be shame about my poor english, great idea master sshaw
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">19:02:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Itxshell&gt;</span> do not think it necsario think of an event to attend bilingual Latin American case it is understood that must handle both languages, if viewed from costs should consider the large number of users in Latin America
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">19:03:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Itxshell, suseROCKs is thinking mostly of the people of florida who are bilingual, many of them know spanish better than english
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">19:03:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sshaw,   having spanish speakers != the necessary skill to properly provide live translation.   Its a very unique skillset regardless of your language abilities.
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">19:04:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,   no I'm not.  i'm thinking we can get a lot of people from Central America to go too
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">19:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> what about creating/translating our sessions into spanish after the conference is over and making ourselves, spanish speakers, readily available for translation if people ask for it?
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">19:04:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,  for example last year when I ws exploring to create an openSUSE event in Guatemala, tian said we could get 30 people just from Guatemala City to attend that event.
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">19:04:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, ok
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">19:04:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I know.  I've done it before
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan,   that is exclusionary and discriminatory.   Why bother inviting in the first place if they have to wait until after.
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">19:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, but I could volunteer to translate for people who want it
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">19:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  how's this...
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">19:06:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we look at the nuts and bolts as we go along,  but for now do we agree whether we want to have a goal of bi-lingual or not?
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">19:06:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let pursue bi-lingual
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">19:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> no matter what you do it will be exclusionary
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">19:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">19:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> I don't speak spanish so therefore I'm ecluded from all spanish sessions
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sshaw,   we have trouble understanding your English too  :-)
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">19:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> and discriminatory because spanish isn't a language I know
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">19:06:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> :)

<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">19:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> would your boss approve $$ for a festival?
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">19:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and cotton candy
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">19:07:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we already have Disney World down the road.  :-)
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">19:08:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but we will not have rollercoster and ferris whells over there? oh no...
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">19:08:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   You and I can visit Disney World after the show.  Ok?
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">19:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> no, sure he will laugh on my face
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">19:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs works at Dysney, he's the old man from "Up"

<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">19:09:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> here's my proposal - That we pursue bi-lingual sessions and leave it to the CFP process to decide how many we receive
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  sounds good
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">19:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it really would be a CFP issue anyway

<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">19:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we will also include a calendar of milestones (see bottom of the wiki page)
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">19:12:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We should start identifying our milestones because we need to move quickly on many fronts

<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">19:13:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We have a date (March 1) for all artwork.  Its important we have posters ready to distribute at FOSS events ASAP to let people know about the event
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">19:14:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anditosan, has volunteered to help with artwork.  CarlosRibeiro  would you like to join in?

<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">19:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> anybody else would like to help with artowrk?
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">19:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> btw artwork needs the formal name of the event

<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">19:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I can do it, I remember that tigerfoot metioned that he could render images for me too
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">19:15:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So I propose the poll deadline be Feb 11 to vote for the name poll.   Agreed?

<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">19:16:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok what other immediate milestones do we need?
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">19:17:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> should we open this oportunity to choose the name to others fellow, that are not involved into the openSUSE ecosystem, I mean
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">19:17:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We have formation of committees by Feb 8
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">19:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   What do you mean?
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">19:17:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> if I create a article about this open pool in portugues, and publish
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">19:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> for sure, more people from brazil will get a chance to choose the right name for get money from their possible sponsors
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">19:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,  Would they come even if they're not part of openSUSE ecosystem?
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">19:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> also, the pool anpunce in portguese and others languages will be a kind of a "Hey openSUSE is here, to help you to help us"
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">19:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, for your question
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">19:19:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> because maybe ppl are not involved in openSUSE, but are involved in education, retails, and other markets that use linux
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">19:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> not "pool" ... "poll"
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">19:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well...   I get your point CarlosRibeiro  and I agree with what you're tyring to sy
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">19:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> *say
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">19:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> so these ppl could be interested in be part of the event not because the openSUSE name, but because our talks, workshops...
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">19:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but...
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">19:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, suseROCKs, if we made it part of our advertisement, surely people would look into other areas where openSUSE is strong
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">19:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> naming is "personal" and I think we should allow openSUSE community to name it, not outsiders.   We hope the community will take those points into consideration
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">19:22:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   The poll will  be conducted on Connect.  What I'm unsure of is whether non-members can vote on a poll in Connect.
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">19:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Anyone else have thoughts on this?
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">19:24:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> suseROCKS - I think most of the milestones are specifc to planning areas.
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">19:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> right, I understood

<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">19:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Create a poll on the openSUSE members list to avoid such an issue
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">19:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> openSUSE members group on connect
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">19:25:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  but the question being raised is whether the naming should be limited to members only.   CarlosRibeiro has some valid points, but I still feel we should have the right to name our own baby.
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">19:25:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> hmmm..
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">19:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> great, you are right, good point, but I believe for naming... maybe should not be a good idea. I don't have sure about that
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">19:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, I see
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:26:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok back to our main topic...
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> breaking down the planning  (and its milestones)
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:27:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> There's a list of planning areas on the wiki, what areas have we missed?
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> artwork, naming, and committee formations are the immediate milestones.
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:28:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> should we let the committees create their own milestones to add to the calendar once they are formed?
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> +1 on that idea
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">19:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I like that idea, set a final submission date for our spread tasks
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">19:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> from marketing and the rest of us plan accordingly
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  let's do that.   Kind of pointless to create their milestones before they've even had a chance to talk amongst themselves
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but does we already have this committee?

<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">19:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I believe we must first talk about volunteers, and after that ask them to see if they don't mind to handle this taks
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">19:30:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   yes  that's what we were just saying a few mins ago, to let them handle the milestones themselves

<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">19:32:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> and more than one volunteer per task
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">19:33:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is everyone looking at the list now?
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">19:33:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> so we have anditosan as first volunterr, right anditosan?

<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">19:37:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I will ask him if there is room to create a sponsor window on it,  presently it doesn't have that feature visible
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">19:37:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Sounds like we have most areas covered then?
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">19:37:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no way to get some space/area inside de app  to let us to try to get a sponsor for that?

<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">19:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I think we have covered the gamut of what needed to be done for kickoff meeting
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">19:39:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">druonysus:</span> how about the program committee?

<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">19:40:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   At some point, we need to give CFP team exact information about hours of session availability.
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">19:41:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> How about the program committee figuring that out
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">19:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   what I meant is...  Do we have all day Fri-Sun  or do we only have Fri-evening to Sun?
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">19:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We don't know (at least those of us not in communication with SUSE) when exactly SUSE will turn over the venue to us.
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">19:42:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I have that information, so will put myself on the program committee
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">19:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Great
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">19:42:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  so let's move on to closing statements

<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">19:42:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ok I want to make something *VERY* clear here
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">19:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  will do
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">19:43:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We have a lot of energy and I think we can make this event a HUGE success.   We see a lot of people wanting to be involved here.
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">19:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And that makes me very excited
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">19:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> hummmmm

<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">19:43:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It is important to recognize one thing.   With all this comes some responsibility....

<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">19:44:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And we, as a community, need to reach out to potential sponsors.  Not rely on SUSE to do all the work
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">19:44:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It is our conference, it is our responsibility, and we can make it happen!
