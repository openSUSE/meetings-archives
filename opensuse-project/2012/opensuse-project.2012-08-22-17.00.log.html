<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">17:11:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> suseROCKS would you like to lead this topic?

<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">17:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  I'm going to do a quick rundown to whet your appetites.  After this you'll wonder why you haven't signed up to go to Summiet yet!
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">17:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> The Summit begins in Orlando Florida on September 21-23.  We have just published our full schedule, although there are still some last minute changes...
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">17:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Summit registration (which is free) gives you free access to the last day of SUSECon

<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">17:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Sessions and workshops begin Friday at 2 p.m.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">17:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this is gonna be blogged soon, right?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">17:16:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Then on Friday at 5 p.m. we kick off our opening Ceremony "openSUSE Around the World" with co-hosts Michael Miller and FunkyPenguin
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">17:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wstephenson,   Yes  tomorrow I will be publishing all this
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">17:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> because this package will be very tempting
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">17:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Friday Night we have ownCloud Poolside dinner party with boat races in the pool.  Build your boat, decorate it and race it across the pond.  Win prizes!
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">17:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And the party also includes an exclusive concert by Honduras nationally renowned musician and openSUSE user, Luis Nieto.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">17:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> That is going to be a lot of fun!
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">17:17:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So pack your swimsuit, cuz you're gonna get wet!
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">17:18:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">17:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> i am SO jealous
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">17:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Saturday, we will have a Luau party sponsored by Omnibond (makers of OrangeFS)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">17:18:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the party includes a polynesian dance/music act.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">17:18:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> unfortunately even if i could bring my family, i think us immigration might object to a 9 month pregnant lady in my entourage.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">17:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> After the performance, we invite everyone who has a musical instrument to grab the stage and blow the roof off with our very own openSUSE JAM SESSION!
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">17:19:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Sunday mornng continues with more sessions, and the afternoon concludes with a general openSUSE Project meeting, where you'll get to sing praises and bitch around.  :-D
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">17:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (no I won't say that in the blog)
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">17:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If openSUSE motto is "Have a lot of fun!" we're aiming to be true to that motto!
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">17:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> how's the programme looking?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">17:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> good.  You can see it on http://summit.opensuse.org    We're still doing final touches but you get a general idea now.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">17:21:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Due to an unexpected scheduling conflict, we may have to change the keynote speaker session.  We will address and resolve that shortly.
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">17:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I expect now to see a flood of registration confirmation emails from all of you  :-)
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">17:23:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> was this fast enough for you wstephenson?  :-)
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">17:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> yes thanks
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">17:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> i'm just annoyed that it scheduling conflicts with our baby #2
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">17:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> There is need for some volunteer help at the summit
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">17:24:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wstephenson,  you should have thought of that 9 months ago  :-)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">17:24:40 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">turns the floor over to partner-in-crime and co-chair AlanClark to discuss the volunteer stuff</span>
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">17:25:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> For example: for the poolside party we could use some help coordinating the contest
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">17:25:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> not more condom references please!
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">17:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">17:26:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> For the luau, we'd like to have an ipod with the 'right' set of music - looking for a volunteer to put that together
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">17:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> If your willing to help with these or other small items send me an email.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">17:26:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> FYI,  We have about 11 attendees from Central America already and they've indicated to me they'd love some Salsa music.     So include that on the playlist if you can  :-D
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">17:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> did we cover everything?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">17:30:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok.  We'd love to see everyone come hula!
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">17:30:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Anything else on this topic?
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">17:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> is awafaa going to be pushing hula/bongo on us again?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">17:31:47 </span><span class="nka">* AlanClark</span> <span class="ac">remembers to bring his camera</span>
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">17:32:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Any other topics for todays meeting?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">17:32:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> or last minute questions?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">17:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> small one from me:
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">17:32:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> go wstephenson
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">17:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> has anyone seen yaloki or knows why he is afk for a long time?
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">17:33:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> we in the opensuse team are going to do the 12.2 banner/ticker if he doesn't this time
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">17:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> wstephenson I called him and he is alive
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">17:33:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> but we'd like to check
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">17:33:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> Not on irc.. But he is active on mails and packman afaik
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">17:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> ok, but is he project-active?
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">17:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> he seems to be really busy on his job can't say more
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">17:34:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> 2nd question: what does the project think of the opensuse team's new approach? we haven't seen a lot of feedback to all the planning and documents Agustin has generated
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">17:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> not sure if that's a judgement or that it's all too late in the release cycle for ppl to get their heads around
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">17:35:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> I'd say it's a good sign that there aren't big protests ;-)
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">17:36:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz_:</span> :)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">17:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> basically agustin is setting our pants on fire by making us make stuff happen, but not the engineering work and 'booster projects' outside of the release process that we've done before
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">17:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> sounds like "new boss, new ideas" ;-)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">17:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> instead we're aiming to boost the whole release
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">17:39:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz_:</span> very much so
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">17:40:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so we did have a split
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">17:40:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hendersj&gt;</span> Personally, I'm liking seeing the visibility of the openSUSE team and what's happening.
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">17:40:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz_&gt;</span> boosting the release sounds like a good idea, given the delay we already have ;-)
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">17:40:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the last thing I saw was AlanClark asking for volunteers.  Then everything went quiet.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">17:41:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> now on different topic.  wstephenson is asking a couple questions
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">17:41:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> sec, pastebinnning for ya
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">17:42:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yeah you're gonna have problems with the meetbot today
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">17:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> http://paste.opensuse.org/73273787
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">17:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> thanks
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">17:43:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> any more feedback for wstephenson?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">17:43:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> let me ask _you_ - what do _you_ think about Augustin's new approach?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">17:43:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Yes.  Tell us what you think of your boss.  :-)
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">17:44:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Everything here is private
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">17:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I give a +1 to Agustin.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">17:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz_:</span> have you heard of the "washing machine phase" theory of organisational change?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">17:45:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz_:</span> first two weeks i was in enhanced spin cycle
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">17:45:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cboltz_&gt;</span> not yet, but it sounds interesting ;-)
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">17:46:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cboltz_:</span> but now i'm enjoying the energy and increased tempo in the office
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">17:46:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nice save  :-)
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">17:47:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> any other questions for the group?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">17:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> we are trying to strike a balance to boost harder, while not demotivating those not on a salary
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">17:48:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> EOT
