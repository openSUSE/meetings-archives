<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Is there an actual proposal?  The membership thread basically went ka-blooey, and I don't see anything concrete yet.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:15:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> robjo - Want to update the summary?
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_lapse_summary
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:15:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> is it right?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:16:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh  didn't realize there's a wiki for it now...  missed that
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Sorry late again, where are we....
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> With no Board quorum at today's meeting, we won't be able to provide any board action
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:16:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> your thing
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, caught up
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The proposal is to lapse membership based on the initial posting in the thread
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:17:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> One recommendation that I have is for the board to take the summary recommendations and for the board to create an action at their F2F
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> i'd like to propose another mechanism, which i didn't do on the thread, ok to present?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The summary provides an overview of the discussion.
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Now, the basic and first decision should be whether or not membership lapse is to be implemented, and then decide on the details.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:18:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> sure
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:19:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> 2 criticisms in the thread were 1) it redefines the initial, unrestricted offer of membership and 2) it adds bureaucracy
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> the mechanism used inside KDE eV negates both
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  I think its good for the board to have an action item on this, however I would push that whatever "overhaul" or "redefinition" is decided on be approved by the membership, rather than by the board.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:20:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> 1) membership is permanent unless ejected or resigned
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> 2) membership is divided into active and passive classes, only the active membership may vote and is needed for vote quorum
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> 3) *important bit* active members become passive by not voting at 2 consecutive AGMs
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> 4) passive members may become active again on request, simply
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:21:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> EOT
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wstephenson,  well isn't the underlying question of the entire discussion about "what is the definition of active"?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what is "AGM"?
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:22:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> The problem I have with this arrangement is that it makes membership all about voting, IMHO membership should all be about contribution
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I am not in favor of voting being a definition of membership because frankly, it is not voting that defines the membership to begin with.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> unfortunately the discussion did focus a bit too much on the voting, partialy my fault as I used it as an example.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:23:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> annual general meeting
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am not sure most people become openSUSE members so they can vote for the board once in a while.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> it makes membership about the business of running a foundation
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I agree that voting is the wrong metric
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:23:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think people want to be openSUSE members as it shows they contribute to the project
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:23:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> right.  The creation of the membership was to "reward" people for their meaningful contributions.  It was a recognition status above all else.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:24:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> we don't have a foundation and status of that is as far as I am concerned in limbo
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> but then we misuse membership because we need a valid quorum to decide things
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the real question is whether your membership should be maintained if you no longer are a contributor.  Since the definition of membership is contribution.
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:25:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Let me give an example:
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:26:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> In my early board days, there was a strong argument that SUSE employees should automatically become members.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:26:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Some have come and gone, for various reasons, and after their departure, they no longer associate with openSUSE.   (Not disparaging them for that...)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but should someone who is gone 4 years still be a member?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> In addition, should someone who does not contribute but only votes every now and then be a member?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:27:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I think not
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:27:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I like the notion that they be placed as Emeritus or passive
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:27:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> yup
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that's what I suggested ;-)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:28:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Hmm.. I have a strange idea
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:28:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Can I ?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:28:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> stop asking if you can talk pls :D
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> Just Do It™
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I don't like the notion of removing people.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> interesting point of view
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Sounds like "Survivor"
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "passive" or "no longer member" in my opinion is the same thing here.  With the exception that you retain all benefits as "passive".    Either one is fine with me.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:29:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> go manugupt1
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:29:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> the current problem is the mismatch between the conditions for entry and the responsibilities of membership
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:29:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Lols.. What about weighted membership or something like that if you are still contibuting in one way or another cool, but as soon as you stop contributing your influence overf the project decreases bya afactor
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:29:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> we let people in who have no interest in the nitty gritty of running an organisation
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:29:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> gets too complicated.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:29:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> ok.. I was typing and did not notice
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:30:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> true. But membership has other perks like the @opensuse.org esp and the title itself which is appreciated by some.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:30:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> hmm
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> weighted, passive, ex-member,  all are same essentially.   The top question which is sstill not being addressed is  "Do we want to make a distinction between currently contributing versus formerly contributing?"
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:31:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  No, the perception will be different
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> yes, to get in you need to contribute, but when you're in contributions have no meaning, you're a member for ever more.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:31:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> but the titel itself, which is meaningful to some, becomes meaningless when once you're in all you have to do is vote.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> One of the things we can do is whatever rules we apply is applicable from now onwards
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:32:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> agreed
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:32:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> maybe we should reboot membership when a foundation is created, using the voting-activity definition
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:32:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> so the oldies are not put off
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:32:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> no grandfather rules please, talk about admin overhead nightmare
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> IMO the oldies and passivies don't care, with a few noisy daemonic exceptions
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:33:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> Foundation no discussion has been going on it and it will take a lot of time
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 wstephenson
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:33:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> so lets just do it
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I believe that even those who are not currently active mostly remain positive about openSUSE and some could be enticed back into activity.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:33:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> Well I hope that some people don't get hurt in the process/or reboot
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:33:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,  well yes,  that's why I said in the thread not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  We should always do everything we can to engage and cultivate our membership
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but that's something we should be doing regardless of status
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:34:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> in any case, we say members are contributors. Once somebody ceases to contribute, he should cease to be member. As we want to recognize past contributions we just turn their membership passive. We want to measure activity accurately but until we can we use the 'click this link once in a while' system. That's your proposal, right?
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:34:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> on that I can only say "yes, let's do that".
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:34:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Not everything will always feel fair for everyone, if we out some rules to vote then there could be more consensus and less hard feelings
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:35:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   that's fine.   and I can agree to that as well.    Provided we have a clear definition of what the passive cutoff is
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:35:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> But there could also be incentives, opensuse members could be entitled to something more than voting, idk what but it would encourage more people to stay active
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:35:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> basically yes, although I do not like the "passive member" distinction.
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:35:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well for now, it's the "doesn't respond to mail". In the future it should improve, include "didn't contribute on OBS AND didn't contribute in voting AND didn't contribute X Y Z etc"

<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">18:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> something else than "passive member"

<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">18:36:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> other name.
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">18:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sure :D

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:36:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I don't care about semantics
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:36:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ...
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> naming is irrelevant at this juncture of the discussion
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:36:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> definition is more important.  We can come up with a nice spiffy name afterward
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:37:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Yes, the idea was never to discredit those that have contributed in the past, their contributions need to be recognized.
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:37:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2012_Ideas#openSUSE_Karma_plugin_for_openSUSE_Connect
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> yes, that can help determine if somebody is active later on
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:37:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> maybe helpful
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:37:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but for now we just have the mail thing as temporary solution
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> until the tooling gets in place
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok - let me jump in as moderator
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I think the final proposal should include a proposal for tooling
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:37:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> Anyway. So based on how I just phrased robjo's proposal, is anyone simply opposed to that or has anyone something against it etc?
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> If passive membership was only seen byt the board and the passive member, we could avoid labeling someone as a non contributing member
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:38:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> manugupt1, some of us are block in deep dungeon called work place that don't allow access to internet.
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:38:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> I am in a workplace where I do not have a net access too
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:38:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> yes, however we solve the "how to measure activity" it has to be all-encompassing. But we're geeks, we'll find the perfect solution :D
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:38:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Basically this goes along wstephenson's idea of "equalizing" the "getting in" and "staying in" requirements
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:38:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> terrorpup,   the majority of our contributors do not contribute during working hours  but in their own free time after working hours
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:39:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> If based on contributions then the member would or could be responsible for reporting to the board, otherwise wed be hunting for their activity which not always leaves a log behind
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:39:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> again, do people agree with the principle that those no longer contributing should loose their 'active' membership and become 'emeritus members'?
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:39:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree to it if it has a nice name rather than passive
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> why are we so afraid of saying in public "member A used to contribute, but does not any longer"
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   I agree
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:39:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> ego I guess
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:39:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> I don't but I can't vote
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:39:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  Because many people are title whores
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if that really gets people to cry in their closet then their in the wrong "business"
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:40:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> terrorpup,   Why can't you vote?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> well there are ways we can measure but it will never be perfect. The board or membership committee should have the final say and of course look at individual cases... not boot somebody because eg he/she just got married or was away from mail for a while...
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:40:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> I can vote on this?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:40:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> terrorpup,   this is a membership discussion, you are a member, no?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:40:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> I thought this was board only thing
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> it's not a vote, we just look for input... it's a PROJECT meeting :D
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:40:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> as well as a board meeting
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> yes last I checked ;)
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no,  in fact board should *not* have final decision on the redefinition.  That would be a conflict of interest.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:41:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but this thing, as I believe suseROCKs said, should be a project vote in the end - it affects all members very directly.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:41:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> exactly
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:41:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> An item such as this needs a membership wide endorsement
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:41:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, +1 however, we need to measure activity effectively
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:41:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok guys - great discussion.  We need to move on to the next topic.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:41:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> First there needs to be agreement that the rules should change.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:42:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> yup. Input on that is good, but for later - as robjo said let's agree on the principle (you do, thanks)
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:42:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 robjo
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> So terrorpup if you disagree what's the reason? What is bad about the proposal?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:42:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Then we can work off the existing proposal, word smith and improve it and then post for a vote
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:42:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'd like to make a suggestion on how to move this topic forward
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> And that should be clearly mentioned robjo
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:42:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I believe that the comments here are starting to align as moderator I would recommend that we have robjo write this up again and place it out on the mailing list for refinement
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:42:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 on that too
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:42:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok but
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> +1 I think we agree on the principle. robjo can come up with an improved proposal... I think we can move on from here.
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:43:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yeah, no bikeshedding!
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> ?
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:43:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> Well because life happens and I think some will look as a puniship
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I was just going to say this time to stay away from bikeshedding
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:43:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> not as hey you been busy, sorry we are marking as such.
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:44:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> terrorpup,  I think we pretty well defined that there needs to be a reasonable period of inactivity before we start "labeling" someone in a new category of membership.
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:44:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> because it is unfair to robjo
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:44:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> so at fosdem i mentioned to lydia pintscher that "openSUSE is infested with professional bikeshedders" and she thought that was quite a good summary of our problems.
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:44:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> The proposal was for a 2 year period of inactivity, yes live happens, but for 2+ years?
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:44:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> well we are looking at something like a 2 year period of inactivity including not responding to emails... Final decision should be a human thing, too...
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:44:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> +1 hehe
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:44:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we talk a lot and do not work that much
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:44:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this should change
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:45:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> 2 years is the period derived from "failure to vote in 2 AGMS" in the KDE mechanism, fwiw
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:45:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> anyway, next item
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> it just seem a bit strange now
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:45:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> robjo - have we reached a point today where you can create a proposal and take it to the mailing list?
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:45:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span>  strange why?
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I will take today's input and the summary I posted on the wiki and create a new proposal

<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:46:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> because I been a member since 2008, and there has not been talk like this, now it like a hot button issue, I am wondering why all of sudden.

<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">18:47:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> you think it's fair that if someone is doing a sh*tload of work he/she has the same voting (and other) rights to stear openSUSE's direction as somebody who hasn't done anything in 3 years? - I bet you think that is indeed unfair and that's what robjo wants to address...

<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">18:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> is what you are working on a proposal or a final procedure?  i.e. will the embership have input or only those that worked on the program?
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">18:52:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but if we see something that we could change for the better it will change
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">18:53:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> All - I think your reading more into this than there is.
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">18:53:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop every member will have input
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">18:53:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> What they are developing is a process for more fairly and as a community - to handle travel fund approval and processing

<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">18:54:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> In short, the idea is that a committee, currently consisting of Izabel and Kostas, will decide on travel sponsorship, instead of me personally. I have made available a budget for that and we (AJ and me, who used to make these decisions together as well as handle the paperwork) have worked with them to explain how we did it and how the procedure should go.
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">18:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> thanks thats it
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">18:54:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">18:54:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> I think everyone gets that, the question is this developed procedure "final" when released, or open for membership discussion/input
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">18:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I would need like a week to type that :D
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">18:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> Much of it is however still a bit hard to define exactly, esp the policies. THey will have to develop over time... At any point, they and us are open for any kind of input...
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">18:55:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, is that for all around the world?
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">18:56:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> yeap
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">18:56:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> warlordfff, thanks you Jos!
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">18:56:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> the 'procedure' is litterally that: a procedure detailing how to submit a request, a form to fill in and a way of sending the papers. The decision is not a procedure but a discussion between the team members (currently 2, maybe more in the future). What else we should add in terms of procedure etc will depend on how it develops.
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">18:57:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> OK, any objective criteria for the decision process?
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">18:57:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we are working for a few months on it so be sure that it is really nice
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">18:57:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> there are some basic rules as to who gets it (sorry, no holiday trips to the bahamas for you) but basically I don't want to define too detailed policies like "don't sponsor this and that" as it's complicated, bikeshed-prone and far better developed in and over time.
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">18:58:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We do not want to end up in a situation where one person gets money and the other person does not for similar/same thing
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">18:58:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> noway
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">18:58:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> true. AJ and me will assist them in the beginning but honestly 90% of the decisions are crystal clear yes or no. For the remaining 10% we can discuss policies in the future... It also depends heavily on the amount of requests vs the money we have...
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">18:58:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I guess where I am going is that we need to eliminate as much as possible the "he/she likes or likes me not me argument"
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">18:59:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">18:59:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> rest assured that especially in the first half year or so we (SUSE/me) will be very relaxed in the budget area to give room for mistakes. IOW if it turns out that we go over budget, that's not a big deal. We have to figure it out on the go...
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">18:59:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a properly well organized event planning (including publicizing on ML and wiki pages) should eliminate overlooking funding one person over another.
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">18:59:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">19:00:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> ok - as moderator I'd like to move us to the next topic
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">19:00:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> true, the like/not like thing should be eliminated. That's why the board has to give a signoff on the program and if people have issues with decisions they can go to the board.
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">19:00:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> hopefully it can speed up getting paid backed.
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">19:00:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> any other questions for warlordfff?
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:00:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span>  Any thing else on this topic?
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:00:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> hit me :D
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:00:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> does the procedure imply full funding or partial?
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:00:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">19:00:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Yes,
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:00:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">terrorpup:</span> yes, we're also working on the procedures, streamlining them. Alan is also on that but it's hard
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">19:01:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> there are a few rules including "up to 80% for travel and hotel unless in special situations" etc
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:01:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> As part of the procedure it would be great to outline the general decision criteria. Not all details are needed, as jospoortvliet says, it's complicated. But some guidelines are needed
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:01:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> most of the 'rules' are common sense, however. It only covers travel and hotel, not food, for example. All in all it's very close to what KDE and GNOME do...
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:01:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> +1
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:01:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   I have to be honest.  80% can be costly in some regions.   20% of travel in US can still add up to quite a bit.
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:01:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> true
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:02:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, that's one of the problems we will have to overcome of course. That is in part also a "we will have to see how it goes" thing.
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:02:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> do you want me to past here some of the criteria?
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:02:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> otoh we don't want to start running a geek travel agency for hanging out with our IRC mates
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:02:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> if the program turns out to be successful and popular etc I can try and get in more monies, by the way.
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">19:02:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wstephenson,  of course not.  And I don't think so far we have abused it in that way
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">19:03:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> if we are a success, we will attract people trying to game the system. i've seen it tried at KDE.
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">19:03:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> just for everybodies information: kostas and izabel have already started making decisions, working with AJ and me. So the program is running, it just isn't announced ;-)
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">19:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> IMHO, criteria as part of the proposal posted on the wiki is sufficient, we do not need that info here ATM

<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">19:04:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wstephenson,   That's why we need to focus on ensuring we shore up local support at events.   It offsets longterm costs as well as reflect what we're going there for in the first place.  :-)

<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">19:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I have a Q now that statuses are done
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">19:40:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> go suseROCKS
<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">19:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> this is more a technical question,  and hoping wstephenson didn't actually leave yet...
<a name="l-529"></a><span class="tm">19:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so out on the social media fronts, I see often people complaining that the "latest release" no longer wors on their existing hardware
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">19:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and its kind of hard to respond to them without knowing why their hardware now fails, but at the same time, those social media comments reflect wrongly/badly on us
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">19:42:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so question 1:  Why do situations happen where previously working hardware no longer works on new release?
<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">19:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> because of the kernel I suppose
<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">19:42:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and 2)  How can we make a better response to those and at the least minimize these "glaring comments" when the majority of users clearly love the latest release?
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">19:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> GNOME3 "requires" accelerated graphics or goes to fall back mode
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">19:43:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> just one example
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">19:43:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the EOL announcement on our own news.o.o is a prime example of "no-longer-works-bashes"
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">19:43:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  the Forums have great response time
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">19:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   yes but its not the forums that I'm concerned with.   Those have a built-in-response mechanism
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">19:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> social media, on the other hand, has a difficult response-mechanism
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">19:44:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">19:44:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> looks like you're the response mechanism
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">19:44:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,  I'm just a marketer  :-D
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">19:44:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if you need an answer for something you have to join the right channels
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">19:45:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> understand your concern, just not sure we can be everywhere and be everything to everyone
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">19:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and Forum or ML's are the ones most popular
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">19:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,  again, not listening.   These are not people "seeking answers"
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">19:45:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok now I am confused :D
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">19:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> These are people declaring "I won't use it anymore cuz the hardware now sucks when it worked before!"  And those negative comments are always louder than positive ones
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">19:45:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ohhh
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">19:45:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> now I get you
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">19:45:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> err sorry im late
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">19:45:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> There will always be those that complain without seeking help. I get your concern but don't know how we would reach out tho those
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">19:46:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I want to mitigate those but at the same time not diminish whateever legitimate issues they do have
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">19:46:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nkrinner&gt;</span> if they only want to troll they should get moderated. everybody else should get a warm text why older hardware isn't supported anymore and be sent to the forums or mailing lists for specific help?
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">19:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nkrinner,   you can't moderate a tweet  :-)
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">19:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> hi FunkyPenguin we're on the last topic Q&amp;A
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">19:46:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nkrinner&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">19:46:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> is the f2f over?
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">19:46:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nkrinner&gt;</span> i  was thinking about facebook comments or things like that
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">19:47:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  it seems that we can't do many things about it
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">19:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> I'm looking at a screen, no faces there
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">19:47:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> the f2f is on the 22nd
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">19:47:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   well what I'm trying to grasp is how we can better understand a "worked before/no longer works now" situation so we can give proper responses.
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">19:47:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> ok.. I thought fosdem thanks
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">19:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> face it, the tech-knowledgable folks are not the ones who tend to monitor social media commentary
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">19:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have to get the right feedback in order to do that
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">19:47:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I am sure you would volunteer for gsoc mentroing :)
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">19:48:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> a tweet this does not work cannot give you that
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">19:48:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's my point  :-)
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">19:48:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Especially when people do "post-and-run"  :-)
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">19:48:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so this is more trolling than anything else
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">19:49:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no I don't think its fair to say its trolling either
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">19:49:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">19:49:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's bad "customer serviice" to consider anyone with a negative comment as being a troller.
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">19:49:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> The problem with "it worked and now doesn't" is that there's no detail, and social media, depite all it's hype does not provide an avenue to have a conversation and understand why.
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">19:49:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 robjo
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">19:49:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> robjo,   Correct
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">19:49:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> plus yes, thechies mostly are ambivalent toward the social media crap
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">19:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so what is your point suseROCKs?
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">19:50:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I mean
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">19:50:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what do you think we should do about it?
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">19:50:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> uhh  warlordfff    Isn't that my question?  :-)
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">19:50:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  I'm not seeing a way to resolve this, in this meeting
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">19:50:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Do we have a facebook page?
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">19:50:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if I had a "I think we should do this.." then I wouldn't bother asking  :-)
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">19:50:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">19:50:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if yes, post on our wall, or whatever the list of things we break
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">19:51:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark,   I don't either.  My only attempt here was to figure out just why people encounter hardware issues that worked but don't.
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">19:51:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> an openSUSE facebook group exists too
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">19:51:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the mroe I understand the better I can come up with responses
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">19:51:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> maybe when you see that respond with the forum URL
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">19:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> One solution is better maintain our HCL list and contribute to smolt
