<a name="l-2"></a><span class="tm">15:00:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> Meeting started Wed Dec 10 15:00:54 2014 UTC.  The chair is robjo. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.

<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">15:01:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Hello and welcome to the openSUSE project meeting
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:03:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The agenda is posted here: https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Project_meeting
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:04:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but it appears that this is the agenda from the last meeting and no one got around to clearing it.
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:04:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I know the tumbleweed topic is definitely not on the agenda today as sysrich is tied up in another meeting
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> With that I'll hang around for a bit to see if people show up for the meeting, if not we'll be done rather quickly.
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> There are AFAIK no open action items from the previous meeting
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> fine with me :)
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:07:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I have a topic: oSC15
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:07:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">oSC15</span>
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:08:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> go
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:08:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> oSC15 is heading straight towards the brick-wall
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because Hans and Robin get next to no help
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it's their first time organizing an oSC
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, that sucks
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so this is going to hurt us
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:09:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if we as a community don't do something about it
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Unfortunately I have been out of the loop for a while :( but I plan to catch up on e-mails meeting minutes and status over the holiday break
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> agreed, thoughts on how to mobilize helpers?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:10:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah everybody is busy
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:11:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but if we don't get this back to at least the status of oSC13 I fear this is going to be the last oSC
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'd assist, but that conference is held in Germany each year is it not?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:11:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> especially from the financial standpoint
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:11:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> no. this year it's in the Netherlands
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Oh, then again, that counts me out :)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> but there is plenty to do https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/osc15/issues?set_filter=1&amp;sort=due_date%2Cid%3Adesc
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> that doesn't require physical presence
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:11:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> the conference this year is in The Netherlands, but just being far away from there does not mean you cannot help
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:12:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I'm not authorized to view that page unfortunately
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:12:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I would love to help in any capacity I can.  I've had a lot of thigns going on lately that have kept my contributions to openSUSE at a minimum, except from filing a bug report for the latest release.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> as in, new baby on the way so my schedule is... well up in the air really
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:13:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> you are now
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:13:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> ahh yes I see that.. thank you
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah everyone is being busy
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:14:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> aye
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> still. we somehow need to pull this off
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:14:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> agreed.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> oSC seems to be a big point for openSUSE throughout the year
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:14:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> Agreed, Hans and Robin need more help
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we need to mobilize people
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> especially people with oSC experience
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> unfortunately it appears that the part of the community that has focused on organizational and other parts of the project has gone to sleep :(
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Anyway, no point in lamenting the situation.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Looking at this list, not sure what I could really contribute to.. Looks like a lot of these will have to do with physical presence at the venue or at least being located close to the venue to accomplish
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:18:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Have you all thought about a call to action for oSC15?  Push an email out to the opensuse members?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Well the meetings have been announced, I suspect attendance has been minimal
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Yeah.. I catch the meeetings mainly as I stalk this channel :)
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Is there a m ailing list that I'm unaware of?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think some things just need to be "assigned"
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I've not assisted with an oSC before so, if I can assist, I will, but looks like a daunting task to me being a noob :)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> As far as mailing lists is concerned we have cfp for those that are/will be on the paper comittee (which I guess still needs to be formed)
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> ahh ok
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:20:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Announcements are suppossed to go to the -project mailing list
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I fear we can't wait for people to react to announcements
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:22:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have to pull people in directly
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:22:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> sending my subscription to opensuse-project now
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> agreed, thus my statement about "assigning" stuff
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so anyone willing to do that?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Well at least the list of tasks is pretty comprehensive, lots of stuff fro me to slug through over the break.
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I will
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:23:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I just need another week to get some more monkeys of my back
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:24:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> opensuse-project a moderated list when it comes to subscriptions?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:24:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> ahh there it is
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:24:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> just took it's sweet time
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no it isn't
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Starting next week I will make a serious push to catch up to oSC15 read all past meeting minutes e-mail go through the list on progress
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> then I will start poking people
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what I meant was: pushing people
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:25:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> not doing stuff yourself
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Ok I'm on the project mailing list now.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:25:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you can push yourself :)
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:25:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but we need someone senior from our community to push other senior(a)s
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:25:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Well I have to find out whom to poke for what tasks, thus I need to be up to speed first
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:26:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:26:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> :)

I'm in the U.S., so not sure what I'll be able to help with.  My wife and I will be having our baby next week, C-section, so I may not be able to respond in a timely manner at all times, hence why I'm a little aprehensive about commitment to anything right now.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:27:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> and my apologies, I'm being pulled into a meeting.. I'll be back as soon as I can
