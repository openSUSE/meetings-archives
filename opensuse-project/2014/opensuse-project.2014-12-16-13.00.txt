* Progress in Redmine  (hcderaad, 13:01:39)
  * hcderaad (and others!) has started to add deadlines on tasks in
    Redmine, this improves the readability.  (hcderaad, 13:01:41)
  * Also the priorities of the individual tasks should become more clear
    this way.  (hcderaad, 13:01:42)
  * Several tasks have been picked up by team members.  (hcderaad,
    13:01:44)
  * Redmine decluttering  (hcderaad, 13:01:45)
  * robined created parent tasks and put the most important orga / promo
    / design tasks underneath them, so the more important things should
    stand out a bit more in the gantt chart.  (hcderaad, 13:01:47)
  * This still needs to be done for software / speakers / network /
    venue, but in principle they all look important and can be filtered
    using category.  (hcderaad, 13:01:48)

* Selection of a logo  (hcderaad, 13:06:48)
  * Several proposals have been made for a logo, many thanks to
    anditosan and victorhck for their great work!  (hcderaad, 13:06:49)
  * We (RobinEd and hcderaad) have decided to go for the last proposal
    by VictorHck

    (hcderaad, 13:06:51)
  * We feel this is the most recognizable logo for both the project and
    the location (Lizards and Escher and The Hague).  (hcderaad,
    13:06:52)
  * ddemaio has already started working on this with some stickers, etc,
    many thanks for that!  (hcderaad, 13:06:54)

    This has been added to redmine.  (hcderaad, 13:06:57)
  * MC Escher foundation contacted by robined, they responded with more
    questions. hcderaad and robined sent them the answers and are
    waiting for more responses.  (hcderaad, 13:06:58)
  * The logo by ddemaio uses the shape of the Escher gecko but robined
    doesnâ€™t think there is any question of there being a copyright
    conflict.  (hcderaad, 13:07:00)
