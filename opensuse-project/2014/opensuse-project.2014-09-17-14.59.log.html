<a name="l-2"></a><span class="tm">14:59:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> Meeting started Wed Sep 17 14:59:44 2014 UTC.  The chair is rbrownsuse. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.
<a name="l-3"></a><span class="tm">14:59:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> Useful Commands: #action #agreed #help #info #idea #link #topic.
<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">15:00:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> There were no action items in the last Project Meeting, so we'll dive right into the one agenda item for todays meeting, the agreed Merger of the Attachmate Group (TAG) and Micro Focus
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:00:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">TAG / Micro Focus Merger</span>
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:03:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> As you may know, SUSE are part of the Attachmate Group, and this group intends to merge into Micro Focus in November. As SUSE are the primary sponsors of openSUSE, they've contacted the Project to assure us that business is usual and that they remain committed to Open Source and openSUSE. We also have Michael_Miller here from SUSE's leadership today. Would you like to add anything before I open the floor for questions?
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:04:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rbrownsuse:</span> Thanks Richard. The SUSE executive team as a whole has discussed this question and we all want to communicate our commitment to openSUSE
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:05:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> I've also encouraged all the SUSE execs to start using openSUSE 13.1 as their work OS :)
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:05:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> :) a mischievous part of me wants to suggest they try Factory..
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:05:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> I've also communicated the MicroFocus leadership about how important openSUSE is to our development/innovation model and our business as a whole and I believe they understand
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:06:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> I'll stop there.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:07:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> Thanks Michael. Alright then everyone, the floor is yours. Does anyone have any questions about this development?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> No questions from anyone? don't be shy
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:10:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I don't have a completely understanding of the entire business model, so no questions from me. As long as openSUSE continues to thrive, I'm happy.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> I'm a huge openSUSE fan and supporter and also very open to questions - so don't hesitate to ask anything you would like
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> I guess most feel like Dominian (or are offline anyway)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Or forgot the meeting time.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:13:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I honestly don't see many of the normal folks active in other channel like #suse, -buildservice, -kde
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Michael_Miller:</span> the main question is: do you like tea ;)
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> :) unfortunately, I'm much more of a coffee type - being in the Seattle area
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> mint sauce then? rbrownsuse takes everything with mint sauce!
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:14:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Michael_Miller:</span> What's your favorite typte of beer?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> (you did say ask anything) ;)
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:15:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> looks like it's just us 4 today anyway
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> and when will I get this chance again?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:15:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> but seriously - his name is Miller...
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:15:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> I did say that:) Right now I'm in an ale phase - with strong but not over-powering hops - not too malty
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:15:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> haha
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> Michael lurks around here more often than you'd think
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Michael_Miller:</span> Good man.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:16:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'm into Stouts, porters. ales.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fudus&gt;</span> Will any of the names change when the merger is done? Or sticking with SUSE/Novell
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I like the darker side of beer
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:16:33 </span><span class="nka">* malcolmlewis</span> <span class="ac">is lurking</span>
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> I can definitely enjoy that also
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Fudus:</span> the names of the brands that we go go market with will not change
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:18:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Fudus:</span> thanks for the first serious question
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:18:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77_work&gt;</span> Quick question (community KDE team member here) - any planned "focus shifts" or similar changes medium-lojng temr?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> hey.. my question was serious...
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77_work:</span> in regards to SUSE, there are no plans to change or future focus areas - we're still focused on the DataCenter, OpenStack Cloud and Distributed Storage for the future
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> sorry, I can't take questions about best beer serious - as it's obvious: the opensuse beer is the best
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:19:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77_work&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Michael_Miller:</span> thanks, that's reassuring
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> hahaha
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> point taken
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77_work:</span> and in terms of openSUSE - we focus on the areas where our contributors focus on ;)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;erakles&gt;</span> When the MicroFocus leadership communicated their decision, was SUSE the aim of the merger or just "fallout"?
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;amon0thoth1&gt;</span> Sorry, I am late. Does anybody knows how is going to be oSUSE infracstructure and hosted sites supported after merge is completed?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:22:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">erakles:</span> Micro Focus was very interested in all of our business units, as they are all very profitable, but (and maybe I have a little bias) they definitely saw SUSE as the big area of growth
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:22:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">amon0thoth1:</span> Michael_Miller can correct me if i'm wrong, but from the communications from SUSE so far, I understand that all of that should stay the same. SUSE are not planning on changing their structure, so their support of our infrastructure should remain the same
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:23:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rbrownsuse:</span> we will port all our server software to visual cobol though
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:23:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Right, even in the announcement email that went out, which I believe Michael_Miller sent to the mailing list explained that all.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:23:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rbrownsuse:</span> that is correct - no plans to change any of that
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:23:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;maxlin_home&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> lol
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:24:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;amon0thoth1&gt;</span> rbrownsuse, Michael_Miller: Thanks
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> or turbo pascal :)
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> turbo pascal was the programming language I learned at school
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;erakles&gt;</span> Thank you Michael_Miller
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:26:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">amon0thoth1:</span> theoretically speaking, this merger could bring opportunities for greater investment into SUSE, which could also lead to SUSE being able to increase their investment into openSUSE. So things like infrastructure from SUSE might benefit from that
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:28:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fudus&gt;</span> Will 13.2 timeline be affected by the merger? By personnel changes at SUSE for instance
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> would you like to answer that? :)
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:28:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fudus&gt;</span> Probably too much to ask at this point :P
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:29:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;amon0thoth1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rbrownsuse:</span> that sounds great! I wish our SUSE and openSUSE developments populate the whole world around.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:29:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Michael_Miller&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Fudus:</span> I won't comment on 13.2 directly but indirectly I will say that there are not personnel changes slated for SUSE staff that may be contributing
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Fudus:</span> the merger is only effective in november. So unless everyone chats on possiblities that may or may not happen, this will have little influence on 13.2 as it's due on nov 04
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> am I right in thinking we could do with more community help putting 13.2 together? is there is a list of open tasks for the release somewhere?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:30:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> but 13.2 is a good topic - perhaps we should switch topic actually
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:31:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rbrownsuse&gt;</span> Okay, hold fire on 13.2 for a little - any last questions on the TAG Merger?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> good thing you ask Richard! Indeed I have such a list of things to help with:
