<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">16:11:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> if we need to do it, I guess you can just send a pull request to change their title in our website
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">16:11:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> There, now Svebor_lap can control the bot :)
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">16:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> thanks
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">16:12:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> is there any risk of upsetting other potential 'Regional' media partners?
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">16:12:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> I also think it is silly, then maybe LinuxVoice or Linux magazin or some other would like to be written global?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">16:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> I don't think there is any risk.. but it's plain unnecessary..
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">16:13:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">16:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> they haven't put up a banner yet
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">16:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> I will say we concluded that it is possible if and when they do
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">16:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> because they really should
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">16:14:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> if they want special treatment
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">16:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> They have putted it today
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">16:14:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> bug.hr for example started rotating the banner and put up an announcement the second time
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">16:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> oh, let me again disable adblock then :-)
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">16:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, cool
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">16:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> Regional it is then.. but not exclusively. bug.hr is read in neghbouring countries too.. and if they ask, we will allow that too then.. ok?
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">16:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, none opposed, vote passed :-)
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">16:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">Svebor pull request the Netokracija "regional media.." title</span>
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> none opposed, and actually +1 from me - anything that makes people happy without making others unhappy sounds good to me, even if it is pointless ;-)
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:19:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> next, Ivan will get accommodation sponsorship from Holobit d.o.o. - can we put their logo somewhere as "adopt a geeko partner"?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">16:20:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ilmehtar, that's true.. partners' happiness is good :-)
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">16:23:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, will ask that on conf. ml.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:25:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">svebor ask about holobit adopt a geeko partner on ml</span>
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> If theres no other agenda items - I would like to make sure you're aware that SUSE are putting together a Booth Box of marketing goodies to send to Dubrovnik?
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, cool, you chatty folks... that's it...now one last thing - how is program making going? anything needed? how can we help if we need to?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ilmehtar, oh, cool! for now we have only Oracle booth. adding SUSE to Trello card
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:28:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> there's a bit of voting left to do on some proposals
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:28:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we currently have roughly 40 hours of content, which is a bit on the low side :(
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> they're sending more than they'd need for just a 'booth' - posters, some hanging banners, fliers, USB sticks, etc
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:29:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think we should have something publishable next week
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:29:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> robjo, do we push people to propose more talks then? try to invite speakers?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:29:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> as far as the schedule is concerned
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:30:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> I think it's too late to push for more talks
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We have to make due with what we have
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">16:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I would be more concerned about having accepted speakers confirm
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">16:31:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> I confirm   =P
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">16:31:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ilmehtar, that's fine. We will find places to put the posters and a place for the goodies..
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">16:31:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> I'll be there.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">16:31:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If we know of someone that generally is a good speaker and has good topics we can accept more talks
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">16:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but doing a general "we need more talks" as this point is pointles
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">16:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor_lap:</span> I'm sure I or someone else will be in touch once they've figured out some more logistics (box, shipping costs, some bits and pieces are still being delivered, etc)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">16:32:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we have certainly more than ~40 hours of proposals but the voting so far has rated a number of them as too low to accept
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">16:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the cfp team will have some more discussions in the next few days.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">16:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we'll see how it turns out
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">16:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> sounds like the best solution would be to get the cfp team to accept as many of the proposals as possible, then see how it turns out
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">16:33:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> I don't know a whole lot about certain things, but I can probably bullshit my way through another talk, if you need filler  =P
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">16:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> well just accepting stuff to fill out the time is not necessarily in our best interest either
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">16:34:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> true
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">16:34:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SFaulken:</span> I think that I know that you know more than you think you know
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> stop telling people that!
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">16:35:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Anyway, I would think that in a week or so we should be able to announce the program
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">16:36:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, I will talk to Ivan and see if we can think of some local speakers that might be good... and let you know.. I guess it can't hurt..
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">16:38:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, I don't have anything else...
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">16:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> question, do we know what the status of tsp is?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">16:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> they do have additional funds and should open for applications, right robjo ?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">16:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I do not know the exact status of the funding, but there was suppossed to be a second round for applications
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">16:40:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> of course at this time it is getting awfully close for booking reasonably priced flights......
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">16:41:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> robjo, or someone from board - could you make that happen?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">16:42:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> it should also be announced on news ..
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">16:43:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I applied and have not received a response just yet and I am worried that my work might not let me go because of it being so sudden. So if possible, could you nugdge that team? :D
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">16:43:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I know there was a TSP conversation between TSP and board but I have not yet caught up to it, I was at a conference last week
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">16:43:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> emailing TSP would probably be the best ?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">16:43:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> I never actually got a response from TSP as to whether they're going to help me out or not.
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">16:43:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> or at least not a definitive one.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">16:44:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> i guess you could try pinging izabel since she at the moment is the only one with access to the app
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">16:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> you might just tell your boss that your are going, canceling should be easy if things fall through ;)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">16:44:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ;:
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">16:44:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">16:44:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span> I did last week
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">16:44:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> all good though, just wanted to mention that
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">16:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">robjo poke TSP</span>
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">16:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> and please let's also spread the info on TSP and any future application opening...
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">16:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> through news, or ML..
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">16:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> that'll be part of the poking ;)
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">16:46:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> great, thanks! :-)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">16:47:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> ok, is that it now? anyone have anything else?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">16:50:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor_lap&gt;</span> that's it than. Next meeting in a week, same time same place...
