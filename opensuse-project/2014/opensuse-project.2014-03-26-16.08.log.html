<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">16:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> also, igustin_cro, any new on JoinUP publishing?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">16:11:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> news*
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">16:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> no, I'll put on Trello until I get twitter password, ok?
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">16:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> I sent mail with presskit to JoinUp editor, waiting for response and publishing
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">16:12:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> igustin_cro, ok then we can talk to stathis about picking them up and pushing to twitter.. maybe that could work too
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">16:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> ok, he is on the trello board so you two should be able to coordinate through it
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">16:14:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> let me write that to trello
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">16:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">16:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> do we need to ping JoinUP about publishing?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">16:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> not jet, I'll ping him soon again, if needed
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">16:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> do you think we can count on it being published before the next week?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">16:17:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> I believe he will, I'll ask him to do that ASAP
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:17:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> what is the real name of stathis, can't find him on Trello...?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> efstathiosiosifidis
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">16:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> and Stathis is his real name :)
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">16:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> ups, sry :)
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> thanks differentreality, it wouldn't be easy to type that :-)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:18:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:18:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I know :)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">igustin_cro will make sure we get published on JoinUP</span>
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> next, we printed stuff and TomoS picked it up
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> Yes I picked posters, tux and cubes.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> did you get any students involved to assemble them, or do you plan to do it yourself? :-)
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:21:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> Preparing tuxes and cubes, I will put them and posters probably tomorrow morning on University
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> maybe that might be a way to lure them to get involved?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:21:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> I just sent Twitter direct message to JoinUp editor asking him to publish annoucement ASAP
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> JoinUp editor answered right now - he will publish JoinUp article very soon
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:23:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> great!
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">16:24:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> so, lucijana and I are exchanging mails with Melanie and producers.. still having troubles with payment and trying to solve them, one of the invoices got misplaced in the process... hopefully we'll solve things on time..
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">16:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> there's nothing we can do here, just wanted to mention it
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">16:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> the smaller invoices I'm paying myself and will ask reimbursement through tsp, as melanie suggested...
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">16:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> and that's about it
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">16:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> next, sesame tavern welcome party issue
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">16:27:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Sesame tavern welcome party issue</span>
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">16:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> JoinUp already published event schedule: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/event/opensuse-conference-2014
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">16:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> we are having difficulty in getting the invoice, the owner is kind of elusive
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">16:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> but he'll publish new article with updated presskit materials
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">16:29:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> they sent the offer, which SUSE cannot use to pay, and we have been asking for invoice for ~3 weeks now
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">16:29:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> why does he do that?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">16:29:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> TomoS went and pinged him in person on Monday
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">16:29:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> but still no invoice!
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">16:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Does he need to be paid before or after the party ?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">16:30:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> we talked before, at one time he said it would be ok even if it was paid for on site
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">16:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> how much is the amount?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">16:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> but, he doesn't respond to emails so it's hard to discuss stuff..
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">16:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> TomoS, do you have any more info from your conversation with him? differentreality, let me take a look at the offer, just a sec
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">16:31:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> ~360€
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">16:32:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> I said to him that we need invoice this week so we can pay him before welcome party. He said that he will send us invoice
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">16:32:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> that is 2750 Kuna
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">16:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> 360 euro? that's it?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">16:33:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> that can be paid by SUSE credit card, right?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">16:33:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">16:33:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> that's "reception for 50 people"
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">16:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> some snacks, sandwiches and drinks
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">16:33:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> On Sesame web page is written that they accept Mastercard and Visa
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">16:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;igustin_cro&gt;</span> to much or to cheap? :)
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">16:34:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> Please do not consider what I'm about to say as 'official', but, my understanding (as a relatively new SUSE Employee) is that all of our Employee cards are a) American Express and b) actually take money out of personal bank accounts which the company then reimburses
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">16:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> yes that's correct. It is an amount that can easily be paid by CC - but be sure to find the specific person that will come with his credit card to pay for that (you need to let them know well in advance) (and between us, that person will only pay with cc *after* the invoice is issued)
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">16:34:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Svebor:</span> the company rates and timings on the payments are very beneficial, but its not like a isolated SUSE card - but we might have something idfferent in place for the conference
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">16:35:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> in an email today Melanie offered to pay a different invoice by credit card, suppose it is her private one then..
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">16:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> anyway, I would like that we pay up front if possible
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">16:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I don't think that's gonna happen
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">16:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> we are past the 30 day timeframe
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">16:36:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> Melanie said credit card payment can be done before... I will ask..
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">16:37:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> but, as elusive as he is I don't trust him no longer to make a deal that someone would pay on site when they get to Dubrovnik
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">16:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> as soon as you have the invoice in your hands, youcan explore options
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">16:38:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yeah.. the plan was to explore alternatives in parallel and if we don't get him to cooperate by Monday, Tuesday, we move to another place..
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">16:38:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> what do you guys think?
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">16:38:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> well we just explored them
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">16:38:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> alternative places I mean..
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">16:39:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> oh, I thought you would already have at least one alternative lined up
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">16:39:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> and by we, I mean TomoS and me try to get simmilar priced offers from a few bars we were looking at before
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">16:39:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yeap, couldn't hurt having in mind a couple of more places
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">16:40:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yes.. there were a few in line in the old town, so we will explore
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">16:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I hope your No 1 question is "Can you issue an invoice to a company that is located in a foreign country?"
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">16:40:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lucijana&gt;</span> :))
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">16:40:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">TomoS and Svebor to try and work it out with Sesame for welcome party and look into possible alternative places</span>
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">16:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yeah...
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">16:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> ok, so that's about it.. does anyone have anything to add?
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">16:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> I'm mostly spamming around, trying to get our banners and announcements published.. hopefully it will all come together in a day or two on a few different sites..
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">16:43:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Svebor:
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">16:44:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> can I just double check with you that we have 3 rooms available for parallel sessions (except for extra room for Press and BoF)?
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">16:45:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">16:45:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> great
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">16:45:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> these 3 rooms include room for workshops?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">16:46:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> there are also booths in one of the amphitheaters, where I thought would be also cool to allow the press to write and watch the action
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">16:46:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> in the back
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">16:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> booths in the amphiteater?
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">16:47:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> cubicles maybe?
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">16:47:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> yes, one of the rooms is a classroom that is suitable for workshops
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">16:47:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> cubicles, right..
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">16:47:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> they are in the back, isolated by glass
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">16:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> worskhop room: does it have computers or is it just desks with chairs?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">16:48:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> guys and girls: deeply sorry for missing this, I just came in
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">16:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> just desks with chairs
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">16:48:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> great, you would need to provision for extra electricity cords for people to plug in their laptops
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">16:48:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> (during workhops that is)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">16:48:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, don't worry, we knew we were in your thoughts
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">16:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sweet :D
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">16:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> Has one computer in workshop room
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">16:48:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> we will still give you hugs :)
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">16:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> TomoS, can you check if there are plugs available for each sitting space?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">16:49:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">TomoS:</span> noted and is that information writter somewhere that I haven't seen? I am a bit lost with the 5 different trello cards concerning the venue
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">16:51:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> probably not - but if I understood correctly, juergen doesn't need / want that computer there anyway..
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">16:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> and yes, we should try and sort out duplicates on trello
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">16:51:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> Here is the link to album with pictures of the venue https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0Edmw0Q9h-SRDNtVXBRN0x5RUU&amp;usp=sharing
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">16:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> by info I meant all the info about the actually available rooms
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">16:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TomoS&gt;</span> workshop room is IMG_4711-4714
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">16:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">16:52:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> whatever
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">16:52:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> differentreality, do we need that computer, or can Juergen replace it?
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">16:53:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I don't need that computer
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:53:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Svebor&gt;</span> the plan was to replace all of them with SUSE laptops that will do the recording
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:53:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> maybe someone doing some fancy workshop that needs some kind of server, might want to use it
