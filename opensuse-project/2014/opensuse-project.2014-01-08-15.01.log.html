<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">15:01:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> who else is here?
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:01:39 </span><span class="nka">* manugupt1</span> <span class="ac">is here</span>
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:02:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so, it seems I forgot to update the agenda after the last meeting and we still have the old items
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:02:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> but we still have this on the agenda:
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:03:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> oSC15 ideas about finding a location
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:03:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> New TSP Team
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:03:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> (and we can discuss again openSUSE in 2016 if wanted)
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:04:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> brb
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:04:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> anything else?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I can probably say a few things about the situation with the forums
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> ah, that'd be good
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:06:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> let's start with that, actually
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:06:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Situation with the forums</span>
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Oh yeah that was mildly disturbing but nit really anything to worry about.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:06:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> not even
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> Okay, so the forums were 'hacked', though I'm informed that technically it was only a breach of a single plugin (the one used for Search Engine Optimisation, SEO)
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:08:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> the hacker was not able to modify anything outside of that single plugin directory, the database was not accessed, no user credentials passwords were breached, though apparently they may have been able to get a list of email addresses
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:08:41 </span><span class="nka">* warlordfff</span> <span class="ac">here</span>
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> The forums are down while the admins tidy everything up, and our friends at suse.com and novell.com who also used the same plugin on their forums have disabled it to protect themselves
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:09:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> That's all I know at the moment
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:09:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> unfortunate but hardly life threatening. I will say however that vbulletin has a long history of weakness esp with the plugin system.
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> Even if they were able to get into the database, because of our use of an SSO solution, the vBulletin database doesn't have our openSUSE.org passwords in it, so that's a relief
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> One might consider migrating to a more hardy solution somewhere in the future.
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar_:</span>  sorry butI was not here intthe beggining, are there any accounts hacked?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> the answer to that question appears to be a pretty firm 'no'
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> cool, thanks
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:11:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar_:</span> Only real effect of it is the rather nasty PR it generates
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> true, but even that has its positives..who'd have thought we had 79,000+ user accounts in our forums, that's awesome :)
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:12:45 </span><span class="nka">* ilmehtar_</span> <span class="ac">always looking on the bright side..</span>
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:12:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Heh the timing was real unfortunaty with suse's keeping servers secure campaign
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:13:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> thanks for the report, ilmehtar_
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> any additional question on the topic?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:15:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:15:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> next one, then
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:16:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">oSC15 ideas about finding a location</span>
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> are you back? :-)
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:16:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">oSC15</span>
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:17:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span>  please echo that ;)
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> that's already the topic :-)
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:17:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> missed that, sorry
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> at least, here
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:17:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I vote Seattle so i can walk there !
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:19:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> As those that follow -project know we have received a last minute proposal from La Laguna on the Canary Islands
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> But in all seriousness i missed the previous meeting on this so ihave no idea where the discussion stands
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> thanks robjo
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:19:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The board has concerns with the location due costs of getting there etc
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> and everything is more expensive on an Island ;)
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:20:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> except sea &amp; sun :-)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:20:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we have not received any other proposals meeting the deadline
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> definitly a cost hurdle for attenders too
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Thus by default this would be the location for oSC15, but....
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:21:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I'd have to roll it into the family vacation
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:21:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> so what are we to do?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> from the boards perspective we basically have 3 options
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 1.) stick with the plan, i.e. La Laguna is the location and we move forward from there and see what happens
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 2.) poke people and try to find another location, this will bend the rules and we might not end up with anything
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:23:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 3.) consider a co-location with another event, such as Linux-Tag, this also bents the rules but with a higher likely hood of having an oSC15 event
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:24:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The decision ultimately rests with the board, but we are quite uncertain about the direction in this case and would like to get more input from the community at large
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:25:26 </span><span class="nka">* coolo</span> <span class="ac">has not seen any news about that - you said "as those that follow -project know". What was the subject of the mail I missed?</span>
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> "University of La Laguna (oSC15)"
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:26:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> From: eduardo@osl.ull.es
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> As nice as La Laguna sounds i honestly can't see people overcoming the cost hurdle the third option takes away from the identity of oSC imho so i think the second option would be the way to go
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:27:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar_:</span> http://lists.opensuse.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?query=Laguna&amp;advanced.x=-102&amp;advanced.y=-116&amp;advanced=yes&amp;list=opensuse-project -&gt; empty
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:28:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> option 2 is only valid if any answer is coming for a real
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> try oSC15
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> try osc15
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:28:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwh_&gt;</span> On the other hand such places where you usually spend your holidays are maybe reachable easier and cheaper than others
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:29:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The message is not in the archive :(
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:29:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> interesting..it was sent to opensuse-project and board@ at the same time..looks like it might have just gotten through to the board and not -project for some reason
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:29:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but it was sent to both the board and the -project list
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar_:</span> it's not in my inbox either
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> so it's in henne's spam filter :)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:29:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> maybe is was dopped from -project because of the attachement, 103 KB pdf file
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:29:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> yeah but attachement could have been the blocker in -project
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:29:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> good thing we have these meetings then ;)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwh_:</span> unfortunately, for the canary islands, "cheaper" is not true :/
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:30:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Sorry for not checking ahead of time about the availability of the message in the archive
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwh_&gt;</span> maybe somebody volunteers for Mallorca, then ;)
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:31:10 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">think time to create a osc15 wiki draft page and dump information there &lt;- vuntz as todo for one of us who have all the data</span>
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:31:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Anyway, the proposal is solid and the team has experience in organizing events having done a KDE event in the past
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> just checking nürnberg flights - Thessaloniki in mai is 153€, Santa Cruz 397€
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:31:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the biggest problem is location and accessibility
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> so indeed quite a bit more expensive
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:32:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwh_:</span> we could rent a boat during one week :-)
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:32:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> not to mention the price of food transportation and lodging
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> you can buy food on canary island too - most people living there do ;)
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span>  nice idea, the geecko boat, carlos will get crazy...
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I've been there before
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> going local check !
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> anyway, the board needs to decide what it wants from the OSC. If it's a come together for those that can afford it, go La Laguna. If it's students learning about openSUSE, LinuxTag sounds more feasible
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> option 2 sounds like a kick in the back of those proposing La Laguna. If you go that route, you have to decline Laguna right away
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:34:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> it's quite a pinch
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:34:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we can also 'rephrase' option 2
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:35:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I mean maybe instead of making a co-host maybe we could make an expand of the event
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:35:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> even if we co-locate with another event we still need a team to do some leg work
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:35:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what do you think?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:35:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Maybe if a discount in lodging can be negotiated to offset the higher travel cost ?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:36:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I've done similar with hotels here in seattle.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:36:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> discount in lodging compared to what?
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:37:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/La_Laguna.jpg - there is a lot of space for camping :)
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> lodging in Thessaloniki was cheap and it will be cheap in Dubrovnik as well
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:37:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> ah, btw. Dubrovnik is 291€ for the same flight options
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> so we'd get +100€ every year
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> (and La Laguna needs bus transfer too, so even more expensive)
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:38:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> even if we could reach the lodging prices at La Laguna we have this year and had last year getting there is still significantly more expensive
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:38:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> dubrovnic is higher than going to Nurnberg for us
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the only thing we can count on with flight prices is that they will always go up ;)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:39:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> linuxTag is already merging with other this year no?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:39:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:39:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> linuxtag always hosted other meetings
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:39:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> but for the Cannaries there are no other options
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:39:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> we would be just another subevent for linuxtag
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> okay in that sense, make it clear...
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:40:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> how about co-hosting with something that changes location every year, like the libre office thing
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:40:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> agreed and we really don't want that.
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> then we need to find motivated german's geeko ...
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:40:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I just threw Linux-Tag out as an example, it could be some other event in Europe, we could do CLT
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:41:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> In the end we have to make a decision soon and the board would like to have more feedback from everyone
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">15:42:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I say we inform the board of our cost concerns and see what happens it's their decision ultimatley.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:42:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Our biggest concern is the cost and accessibility restrictions
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:42:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> I think the board is aware of the cost concerns :-)
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:42:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:42:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> the main question is whether we all believe it's a blocker or not
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:42:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> I certainly do
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:42:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> (my opinion is that it is)
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">15:43:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> and then the followup question is which is our next step between options 2 and 3 that robjo mentioned
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I think SUSE would send only very few employees. The concerns about Thessaloniki were already high and Teneriffa sounds even more like vacation trip to the manager's ear
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:44:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> that's a good point too
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:44:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well I certainly think that this is worth searching for a while
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:44:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Sounds like we (the board) need to take this to the -project list to get more input
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:44:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> yeah; it's unfortunate we didn't notice the mail didn't reach the public list :/
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:44:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'll send a message today
