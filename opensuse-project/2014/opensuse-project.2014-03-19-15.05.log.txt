15:06:14 <robjo> Hello and welcome to the project meeting
15:06:44 <robjo> The agenda (http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Project_meeting) has no new entries
15:06:50 <robjo> anything wee need to discuss?
15:07:17 <robjo> Don't forget the conference organization meeting happens in about an hour from now
15:07:34 <jospoortvliet> actually, I have to share something...
15:07:45 <robjo> Go
15:07:47 <ilmehtar> robjo: With everything I read and heard about our booth at CLT, tux93 and the others who helped deserve congratulations :)
15:07:51 <jospoortvliet> http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2014/03/leaving-suse.html
15:08:03 <jospoortvliet> I'll be leaving SUSE by the end of this month.
15:09:21 <ilmehtar> jospoortvliet: It's going to be sad to see you go, but I hope you're still going to be able to contribute to openSUSE?
15:09:41 <jospoortvliet> I hope to stay around, esp when it comes to news.o.o writing.
15:09:48 <jospoortvliet> and I'll be at oSC, talk there etc...
15:09:55 <robjo> jospoortvliet: Good luck
15:10:00 <jospoortvliet> but usually - new job means busy busy, the first months especially.
15:10:30 <jospoortvliet> robjo: thanks
15:10:37 <ilmehtar> jospoortvliet: of course. do you think you're going to be able to hand over everything that needs handing over okay?
15:10:56 <jospoortvliet> ilmehtar: yes, I think that won't be a problem.
15:11:16 <jospoortvliet> most writing for oSC is done or can be prepared and otherwise, I have already handed over things.
15:11:31 <jospoortvliet> press is taken care off, we've got our media partners and they can keep talking to me, no problem at all.
15:13:24 <robjo> Anything else?
15:13:34 <ilmehtar> jospoortvliet: well then, it's not really 'goodbye', but more 'good luck' and many thanks... and now you'll get to do stuff in openSUSE just for the fun for it rather than the money too! ;-P (joke)
15:13:41 <jospoortvliet> hehe
15:15:54 <robjo> I guess it's a short meeting then
15:16:06 <robjo> Thanks for sharing the new jospoortvliet
15:16:21 <robjo> thanks to everyone for showing up
