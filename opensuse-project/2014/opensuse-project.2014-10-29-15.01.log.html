<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:02:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> There were no action items from the last meeting
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:02:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I don't see any action items outstanding from the last meeting minutes, but I didn't make the meeting. Is there anything people consider 'open' from the last or recent openSUSE project meetings?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:03:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> Well that makes it simple enough then.. moving on..

<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:03:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I put this in there, because I figured there might be some discussion about the recent announcement to merge the Factory and Tumbleweed rolling release - does anyone have any questions about what's going on?
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:05:34 </span><span class="nka">* mrdocs</span> <span class="ac">waves</span>
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> good morning! do you have a question, or just saying hello? :)
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:06:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> just saying hello :)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> Okay, well, I'm judging by the broad silence and the tumbleweeds floating by, no one has any questions about the decision to rejig our rolling releases... I'll give another 30 seconds or so in case someone is just being shy and not speaking up :)
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:09:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> I only have a couple of comments on the execution :)
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> Okay then..
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> go ahead :)
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> is there a reason why this wasn't really discussed on -factory?
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> respectively I'm asking myself why this wasn't brought forward on news@
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:13:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> it was no https://news.opensuse.org/2014/10/24/tumbleweed-factory-rolling-releases-to-merge/
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that's the result yes
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:13:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no discussion
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> yes but henne does have a point, me and Douglas did not follow the proper procedure of actually discussing it with the news team before announcing it, and it has been kind of unconventional how this all came about in the first place
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:14:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I'm happy to explain the circumstances though
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:14:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you should
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> I agree with henne, everything seemed to simply happen overnight (and sure that was not really the case)
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:15:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:15:54 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">okay .. the discussing internal news team part was hidden procedural part :-)</span>
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> first, the not mailing news@ bit first - mea culpa - the decision to announce the merger was actually made some days before the post on news.o.o, but a lot of the final decisions, agreement from Greg, etc, came and clashed with my travel to openSUSE summit
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:17:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> It's just sad that this was pushed out without thinking about anything
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> so, I ended up announcing it at Summit, and then we played catch up by announcing it on news.o.o when I got back from behind the Great Firewall of China. It's not ideal, and actually I thought news@ had been involved before we pulled the trigger with the post - but I didn't double check that myself, so I'm sorry to the news team
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:17:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it could have had a ton more impact
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:17:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> just by involving people
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well no need to be sorry for the news team. be sorry for this announcement :)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:18:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> not sorry FOR the news team, sorry to them :) they should have been more involved
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:18:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> Hi
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:18:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmanu:</span> Hi
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> I am manugupt1 by the way
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> next time, stick to the process
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> Regarding news team, I dont know if it will matter a lot or not for making announcements or discussing with the news team
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> Yes, I intend to
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> because WE DO NOT review articles
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> We miss posting articles when someone else asks to
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because if we would have made a propper announcement. with propoer content, proper notification to the press
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> propoer press-kit
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> proper FAQ
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:20:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> proper timing
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> When was such stuff discussed
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:20:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> last
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> Lets get realistic over here
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this could have easily been on of the greatest announcements we ever did
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:21:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> had to literally go on marketing and project mailing list to ask for more help with his articles
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:21:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> and then people came to help in
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:21:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> well, I see where henne wants to go and I completely agree that the timing was really non-optimal. But I'm not sure if our current "marketing" machinery is as good as he believes
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:21:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> +1
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I'm not unhappy with how well the announcement has been received, how far it's spread, how people seem to have picked up the message, but I do agree with henne we could do better, but I also see it's going to take us a little time to get there
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:22:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmanu:</span> yes, and all I got was an English proof read by plinnell (thanks a lot)
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> SUSE have hired Douglas DeMaio to help us out in that area, but he's got to learn to, so I consider henne's feedback as good 'lessons learned' from this
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:22:47 </span><span class="nka">* plinnell</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> I am not saying people should learn
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:23:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> I am pointing to the fact that there is something fundamentally flawed with the news and marketing team
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:23:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> I wrote almost every single word of the 13.2 release announcement and, taking into account that I don't consider myself part of the marketing team, that is not optimal
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> We need to fix that before talking about process
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:23:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ancorgs, gmanu: if I would have seen a mail on news@ I would have dropped everything and worked on this
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes we have not too many people
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:23:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes they are not too responsive
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> is that a reason to just ignore everyone? no
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> no, I agree with your main point
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> if we had access to archives for news@oo
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> all I say is that maybe you was a little bit optimistic in the expectations :-)
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> I'm perfect aware of how it is :)
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> We can easily find out how many articles we as a news team ignore
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:25:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> still
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:25:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> about press kit, FAQ and all that
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I would have worked on this immediately
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but I didn't have the chance
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I would have, if sysrich would have gone through the proper process
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I think it's fair to say we know we have improvements to make in this area, we've got a guy who's now paid to help in this area, I think we're on the right track - but people (like me) doing stupid stuff like bypassing news@ out of convenience doesn't help, I think that's henne's point, and I agree with it
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> and I know henne would have done a great job, as he did when we "announced" factory as rollling
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:26:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> again.. having a paid guy does not solve the problem of getting people involved
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> guess who's training Douglas BTW :-Ü
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:26:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> guess who trained Jos
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ...
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> let me guess - he's started ignoring everything I'm telling him and doing what he thinks is best...so, I guess you're spending too much time with him ;)
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:27:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that was only one remark I had
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what about the discussion on -factory?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> Having a person payed by SUSE is just a patch. The release is big enough for not needing "a payed guy" behind. And look what is happening this time :-(
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> it happened every time
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:28:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> in the end it was always me or Jos
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I asked news team for press support for openSUSE Asia Summit
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:28:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and who cares who pays our salary. we don't :)
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:28:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> Did not get a single review
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:29:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> I just checked that between
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:29:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> we are mixing two discussiong (mainly my fault)
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmanu:</span> what has that to do with this discussion?
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:29:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> let's focus on the merge and let's go back to marketing status afterward
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:30:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmanu&gt;</span> cool..
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> okay, back to the merge "Why wasn't this discussed on -factory" - I could write a really long story here, but I'm going to try my best to keep it succinct. The short version is I and others realised that the roadmap for Tumbleweed was effectively a 'dead end'
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I thought he merge discussion was done, henne is right, sysrich knows better and will not go astray again ;)
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:33:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> I was really worried about 5000 users, who'd find their rolling release screeching to a halt with the release of 13.2 because GregKH has already decided that he wouldn't be continuing Tumbleweed as an add-on repo ontop of our regular rolling release. So, I got chatting with the 'key' people involved, Factory maintainers, leading contributors, GregKH, to try and find a way to bring the Tumbleweed and Factory rolling releases together to
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:33:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> handle the otherwise 'death of Tumbleweed' in a nice way for everyone
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:34:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> If we had more time before the release of 13.2, sure, I would have, and should have, probably opened up the discussion to the whole of the -factory ML, but we were short on time, and we don't always open up every major change to the distribution to those kind of broad discussions
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well, I would like to disagree. We at least tell our peers before we make it so...
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:35:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> and you think we didn't do that here?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:35:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> probably the merge was out of question (and my feeling is that most people is happy about it), but I would have prefered to have a voice on the timing
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:36:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> ancorgs well, you still do - whats your opinion on the timing?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> where did you?
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:37:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> making it collide with the release is making everything messy. I cannot see the downsides of doing it some weeks later
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:37:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> from the communication point of view, at least
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> the announcement and my FAQ/opening discussion post on the -factory ML which, while late, explicitly invited people to discuss, ask questions, etc
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:38:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sysrich:</span> the announcement says: with the tested, user-ready rolling release assuming the name Tumbleweed from Nov. 4
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:38:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> done deal
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:38:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysrich&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> waiting until after the release is messy from a current-Tumbleweed user point of view, as the 13.2 Release will 'zero' their Tumbleweed repositories and never fill them again
