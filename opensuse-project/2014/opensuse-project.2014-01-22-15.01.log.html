<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:05:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> we have about two weeks to submit our applications
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:06:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> we havent had much activity so far
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:06:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> I only see two ideas so far on the page :/
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> out of curiosity, do we know how advanced our peers are with gsoc ideas?
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:08:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> hello folks ...
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> awafaa Fedora's got a few things lined up
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">awafaa:</span> KDE, Fedora and GNOME are prety active
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:09:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Apache too
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:10:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> ok so we really need to somehow step up a gear, any ideas on how to do that?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> here now
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:10:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> We need People willing to mentor
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I guess we can ask and ping
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:11:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> not to mention a large calibre proposal
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> i had put in a reminder mail about a few days back. i can do the same again
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> some solid ideas from the OBS and YaST team could also be added
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> the 2 current gsoc ideas are rather tame.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> please do re-send
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Kigurame I think we will be able to get them
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Openqa too..
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> I had some enquiries from students too, about GSoC projects
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> anybody got updates on marketing materials? someone from the marketing team?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:14:08 </span><span class="nka">* warlordfff</span> <span class="ac">here</span>
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:14:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> let's do that topic next, after we're done with gsoc
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:14:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Awafaa can you ping arm list once again, we should have at least hardware relayed project
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> yes, sure ;)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> vuntz, manugupt1, awafaa: what about collaborating with other orgs this time?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> try less broadcasting :-)
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> means go to specific people
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:16:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> it's up to you, the gsoc admins, if we want to do it
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I am Into it but owncloud and hedgewars are applying
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:16:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> agree to that :)
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:16:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> but I think we'll want to
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:17:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Henne we still have not seen your ideas :-)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> ok i'll ask
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:17:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> true :)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:17:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> from the last meeting for orgs that didnt make it, it was clear that Google encourages orgs to collaborate and participate under a common umbrella
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> it helps if you ask me directly
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:18:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Henne I know.. I will.do that once I am home
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> One more thing
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Like some mentors do not have all the skill set like ui.toolkits but will still like to mentor, can we ask the students to take help from mailing lists directly
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:20:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Like it may seem that one yast guy may not have the time to mentor but a group of people can certainly help
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:21:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> of course
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:21:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> i'd have no problem answering questions on a mailing list
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> co-mentors?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:21:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> we still need a mentor, though
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:22:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I just don't have the time for that atm.
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:22:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Saurabhsood91 I know a lot of people not willing to mentor but have time to help via ml
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> but i'd be happy to answer to a problem on the ML
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:23:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> agreed
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> ok...but isnt it a potential problem? i mean delayed replies or something like that?
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:24:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Then the student needs to fund his way.. but under openSUSE I personally have not seen delays more than 48 hours
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saurabhsood91&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> +1 :)
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:25:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> we could also just have a IRC channel for rapid response stuff
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saurabhsood91:</span> I've just gone through github: http://paste.opensuse.org/15797547

<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> that was the question from ishwon
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:30:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> anybody got an update?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> I dont have the whole picture, but I do know the openSUSE team have produced a bunch of marketing materials for FOSDEM which I understand are effectively the first steps in fixing the wider issue
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> The new flyers look pretty impressive
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:30:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> yes, i saw that in the mailing list. didn't get a glimpse of the gears though.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> any pictures around?
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:31:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> I have my phone with me, I guess if I can pinch one of the flyers I can put some pictures up somewhere
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> yup, that'll be great. thanks. i have an event ahead, "Corsair Hackers Reboot". A date hasn't been fixed yet though.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> I'm setting up an openSUSE booth there
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:33:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> related to this: any update on the sponsoring for local production of materials?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:33:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> Got 2 laptops, a couple of posters/banners that I'm gonna print.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:33:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> My only issue is production of DVDs.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> I also checked out for printing openSUSE notebook stickers, it's too expensive here.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:34:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> Maybe I'll order only a few around from unixstickers.com
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:35:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span> Sadly no, but it is already is on the Agenda for the Face to Face Board meeting which happens in a few weeks - the Board should have an opportunity to talk to the appropriate people at SUSE then
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:35:42 </span><span class="nka">* vuntz</span> <span class="ac">was about to say what ilmehtar wrote</span>
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:36:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> I know unixstickers.com actually produced some of the materials for us at FOSDEM :)
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:36:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> ok thanks, just asking someone doing the openSUSE booth at CLT asked me
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:37:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Question
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:37:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> *because
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:37:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> oh, in that case, does openSUSE get discount coupons on large orders? If yes, I could order large number of stickers from unixstickers.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> Yet still, for the DVD production I'm kinda stuck.
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:38:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> The only materials that are ok on my end are posters, flyers &amp; banners. Maybe T-shirt as well can be arranged (I'll have to check around).
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> No we don't get discounts on large orders - when we gave them permission to use the openSUSE logo, we did request they provide the project with some free stickers, but those free stickers (and more which SUSE have kindly paid for) are the ones they're providing for FOSDEM
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:40:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Can I aak a question, is it possible to open local shops from which SUSE can order that saves shipping cost and asia is cheaper than eu afaik
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:40:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ishwon:</span> I will drop my contact at unixstickers.com an email though, and see if something like that could be arranged for our Advocates. It's worth asking at least :)
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:40:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> ok, i'll just order a few of the stickers &amp; push pins then, as budget permits.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> maybe it's good to look into some form of crowdfunding for small events ?
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:40:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> yeah, that'll nice. thanks.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:41:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> i didn't get the question?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:41:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> hit me with an action item?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:41:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> any of that material for FOSDEM happens to be the one we asked Jos to take care of regarding oSC14?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:41:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> so there are some funds available outside of suse or sponsors for small stuff.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> the oSC14 promotional stuff (posters + others?) went to the printers, yes
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> great tnx :)
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:42:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">ilmehtar to ask unixstickers.com if we can get discounts on large orders for our advocates</span>
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:42:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kigurame:</span> that's an interesting idea, biggest question to answer would be 'where does the money go?' - the openSUSE Project doesn't have its own bank account
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:42:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I mean we may setup local contracts that can ship stuff and through reimbursement scheme they can reimburse the contractor
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> that's a good question with cloverleaf we just setup a account for the non profit and appointed a treasures
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:45:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Then public quarterly reports so all this might be too much work

<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:49:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so if there's anything you think we should discuss there, please tell us!

<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:50:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Can't really think of anything.
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:50:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Can the board put its agenda of discussion do that people
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:50:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Have ideas
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I don't know if it is a good idea

<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:51:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> And I.have no opinions
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:51:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> I think the expectation is we'll publish a Public Agenda before the meeting and Minutes afterwards, just like we always do for our non-face-to-face meetings
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:52:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ilmehtar&gt;</span> but we want to make sure we talk about topics that matter to the community (us, we, the people here now), not just the topics we think that matter :)
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:53:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:53:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I did not understand sorry
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:53:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> I beg your pardon, ilmehtar I was thinking the inverse :-)
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:54:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> To add  a point, ask openSUSE Team to report back soon their conclusion &amp; analysis about Factory, 2016 objective, and anything else.
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:56:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> you can edit the agenda ;-)
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:56:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> ok, anything else?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:56:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:56:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Would someone like to help out with finalizing and posting in news the announcement for oSC14 CfP open? It was supposed to go out on Monday but hasn't. A draft with main information is provided https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXw9yZKNAtYQLxrv7hz0bKDE6jGaYwCoAXFcW1fX4TQ/edit#heading=h.2zahdoz8jleb (2nd announcement - CfP opens)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:59:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> so you need someone from the news team?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:00:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">16:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> have you mailed news@o.o?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">16:02:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> not for this particular issue. We had discussed some time ago, well mainly Jos said that he could do the editing and adding if we provided a draft with the actual info
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">16:03:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Just give Jos a poke then.
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">16:03:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Jos is not around
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">16:04:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I can poke him but I doubt he has time
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">16:04:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> it's always best to mail news@o.o
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">16:04:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> that's my impression too
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">16:05:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> honestly maybe Svebor did actually contact news@, I am not sure, I am just asking the question because Svebor couldnt attend and he asked me
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">16:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> there is an article on news.o.o already, right?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">16:05:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kigurame&gt;</span> Gave him a little nudge anyway.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">16:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> if there isn't - it will have to be written still...
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">16:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> there is the first article announcing oSC14 is in Croatia
