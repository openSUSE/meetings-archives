* Tracks and proposed talks  (hcderaad, 13:01:10)
  * We need more talks, or we need to limit tracks. We currently have 20
    talks, we expect more people to submit closer to the date.
    (hcderaad, 13:01:11)
  * Also some of the talks seem to be somewhat
    only-promotional/commercial. We don’t want to give the impression
    that submitting a talk is the same as having it accepted.
    (hcderaad, 13:01:13)
  * Also a possibility is to have 2 full time rooms for development and
    guided trainings. We can choose subjects that are important to
    openSUSE  (hcderaad, 13:01:14)
  * As criteria for the selection of talks we will apply these
    principles:  (hcderaad, 13:01:16)
  * - Directly openSUSE related stuff  (hcderaad, 13:01:17)
  * - Technically interesting (first time installations, etc)
    (hcderaad, 13:01:19)
  * - Community building (interactions between communities)  (hcderaad,
    13:01:20)
  * - Business development value - based on open source  (hcderaad,
    13:01:22)

* Keynotes  (hcderaad, 13:12:10)
  * We can have 8 of them, 2 per day (starting session and closing
    session), we don’t want to fill them all up already.  (hcderaad,
    13:12:12)
  * Confirmed:  (hcderaad, 13:12:13)
  * - Aaron Seigo (yay!)  (hcderaad, 13:12:15)
  * - SUSE (to be announced)  (hcderaad, 13:12:16)
  * - openSUSE Board  (hcderaad, 13:12:18)
  * This leaves five slots, we have at least 1 potential at the moment
    who still needs to confirm.  (hcderaad, 13:12:19)

* Promotion on FOSDEM and Scale (and other confs)  (hcderaad, 13:14:56)
  * Social event is coming along nicely, sat 31st of january from 19h
    Cafe Belga here we come!  (hcderaad, 13:14:57)
  * Hopefully we can invite more people to that and push the conference
    there  (hcderaad, 13:14:59)
  * Request to all community members, promote the social event at
    FOSDEM!  (hcderaad, 13:15:00)
  * ddemaio will bring stickers, warlordfff has offered to make
    buttons/pins, hcderaad will bring some generic openSUSE stuff (flag,
    empty USB sticks, ets).  (hcderaad, 13:15:02)
  * if possible we want USB sticks printed with the date of the
    conference on them. We hope to preload them with openSUSE live so
    that people can use them and be reminded of the conference.
