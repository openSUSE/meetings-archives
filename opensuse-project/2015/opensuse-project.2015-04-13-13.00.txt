* Swag and printed materials  (hcderaad, 13:15:18)
  * With little over 3 weeks to go we also need to start to focus on the
    physical conference items!  (hcderaad, 13:15:20)
  * This presents us with a challenge, because we expect quite a lot of
    last minute registrations, we’re not sure how many items to order.
    (hcderaad, 13:15:21)
  * We therefore suggest to get some extra “headroom” and ordering
    plastic bags instead of cotton. We’re simply using the Conference
    Logo as startint point.  (hcderaad, 13:15:23)
  * From the Tourist info board we will receive enough city maps and
    other tourist info.  (hcderaad, 13:15:24)
  * The sponsors will be approached to deliver their swag in time as
    well.  (hcderaad, 13:15:26)
  * If we save money with this approach, we’ll be sure to spend that on
    the conference itself and the social events!  (hcderaad, 13:15:27)

* Other points by participants  (hcderaad, 13:17:03)

* Next meeting  (hcderaad, 13:17:32)
  * Monday 20th April 13 UTC and 15 CEST  (hcderaad, 13:17:33)



Meeting ended at 13:17:52 UTC.
