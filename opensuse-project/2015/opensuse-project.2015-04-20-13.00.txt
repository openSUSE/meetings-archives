* Location  (RobinEd, 13:03:57)
  * hcderaad and robined have visited the location and determined which
    rooms will be used for what purpose.  (RobinEd, 13:03:57)
  * Food will be provided by the location chefs, they will buy food
    wholesale and lunch will be buffet style (bread, cheese, meat with
    different salads on different days). Vegetarians and gluten-allergy
    people will be catered for. On Friday night basic food can be bought
    at the location for dinner, but there is no real social event
    planned. On Saturday and Sunday we will have BBQ’s before the
    parties. On Monday night dinner can again be bough  (RobinEd,
    13:03:57)
  * We have left Friday and Monday nights free, so that people can visit
    the Hague whilst they are there. We will talk to a bar (cafe Rootz)
    and see if we can get conf visitors benefits if they go there. Rootz
    is in the middle of an area with lots of other cafes in the centre
    of the Hague, so it’s a good place to go exploring from.  (RobinEd,

* Scheduling  (RobinEd, 13:07:13)
  * Robined and hcderaad are busy scheduling all the talks. We have 44
    confirmed talks, workshops and QAs. A number are still unconfirmed.
    Due to issues with OSEM (which differentreality is helping to solve
    - thanks for that!) we have had to pull all the info into a
    spreadsheet and are working from there. This is costing more time
    than we expected, so this is an ongoing job for us, which will take
    a few more days.  (RobinEd, 13:07:13)

* Volunteers  (RobinEd, 13:12:32)
  * we will be contacting volunteers the coming weeks to coordinate
    tasks with them.  (RobinEd, 13:12:32)
