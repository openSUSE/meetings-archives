* Schedule and promotion  (hcderaad, 09:01:52)
  * The schedule has (almost) been finished (yay!) and can be seen
    online. Can a newspost please be made and published all over the
    Social Medias?  (hcderaad, 09:01:54)
  * Also we could really use more visibility on social media, our posts
    are being picked up reasonably well, but please everyone, repost our
    messages!  (hcderaad, 09:01:55)

* Booklet and swag  (hcderaad, 09:03:17)
  * no foreword texts have been received from anyone so we will make up
    our own.  (hcderaad, 09:03:18)
  * We’re trying to finalize the booklet info today and add that to the
    swag for the conference!  (hcderaad, 09:03:20)
  * We’ll ask SUSE for more swag and whatever we come up with you’ll see
    at the conference!  (hcderaad, 09:03:21)

* OSEM problems and “solutions”  (hcderaad, 09:04:30)
  * During the past weeks we have had a lot of problems with missing
    features and bugs in OSEM. The most pressing ones were:  (hcderaad,
    09:04:32)
  * - Not being able to schedule talks due to the scheduling interface
    not working correctly, tracks are “jumping” around on the drag and
    drop interface.  (hcderaad, 09:04:33)
  * - No export of schedule talks and comments  (hcderaad, 09:04:35)
  * - Very limited search in scheduling tool (one search field, and
    searches (+amount of results) are not “remembered”. No filtering.
    Also in speaker tool.  (hcderaad, 09:04:36)
  * - events from other conferences in scheduling tool  (hcderaad,
    09:04:38)
  * - no scrollbar in scheduling tool and incorrect list of talks for
    scheduling  (hcderaad, 09:04:39)
  * - Not being able to export attendees and registrations for sleepover
    (hcderaad, 09:04:41)
  * - Not being able to register talks for other people or change
    speaker names  (hcderaad, 09:04:42)
  * - Not having a track listing without scheduling talks  (hcderaad,
    09:04:44)
  * - No view of track type in schedule during scheduling  (hcderaad,
    09:04:45)
  * Some of these issues were solved by the volunteers behind OSEM, and
    we are thankful for that, but this has cost us more than 4 full days
    extra work, which is totally unworkable.  (hcderaad, 09:04:47)
  * Some of the responses we received after posting issues beggar
    belief: “Not an issue”, “There are no technical issues” and “Create
    a fake profile and fill in all the info again” are among the ones
    that left our mouths the most open.  (hcderaad, 09:04:48)
  * We strongly advise openSUSE to take a look at other platforms and
    consider switching to a more generic solution instead of the
    self-built OSEM.  (hcderaad, 09:04:50)

* Social Events  (hcderaad, 09:05:43)
  * There are some interesting entertainers lined up for the social
    events on Saturday and Sunday: mystics will read your aura and help
    you find the future using totally scientific (;)) Tarot methodology
    (hcderaad, 09:05:44)
  * Also we'll have vintage computer game consoles!  (hcderaad,
    09:05:55)
  * We have a lock picking workshop!  (hcderaad, 09:06:01)
  * Basically You are Your own host, so help us to help you make it a
    very cool evening program!  (hcderaad, 09:06:27)
  * Everyone is a volunteer!  (RobinEd, 09:06:37)

* Volunteers  (hcderaad, 09:06:51)
  * we will need them! Especially around the lunches and dinners. We
    expect to need at least 5 - 10 for each lunch and 3 - 4 for each
    dinner. Who will coordinate volunteers?  (hcderaad, 09:06:52)
  * We'll make a little list of tasks todo at the conference and we'll
    coordinate this on thursday  (hcderaad, 09:07:09)
  * The venue will need decoration and technical support (setting up
    stuff) so, any help is welcome!  (hcderaad, 09:07:28)

* Next meeting  (hcderaad, 09:08:35)
  * See you Thursday for the build up and on Friday for the start of the
    Conference!  (hcderaad, 09:08:36)
