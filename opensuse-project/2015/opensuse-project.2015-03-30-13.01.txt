* Promotion  (hcderaad, 13:03:42)
  * The current status of the attendees for the conference is quite
    dissapointing and with only 4 weeks we really need to up our game.
    (hcderaad, 13:03:43)
  * ddmaio is working on online banners which need to be sent to all
    interested parties so that they can help out in this.  (hcderaad,
    13:03:45)
  * We actively need to invite other communities to participate in the
    conference, because the openSUSE community itself seems to be not
    very responsive.  (hcderaad, 13:03:46)
  * hcderaad and RobinEd have already contacted GNOME, KDE, NLUUG,
    NLLGG, Diaspora. Everyone is requested to contact their own local
    (and international) communities to attend the conference.
    (hcderaad, 13:03:48)
  * The target for attendees is 200, at the moment were at about 50%,
    with more than half of that being speakers.  (hcderaad, 13:03:49)
  * If we want openSUSE Conference to remain a relevant event for future
    editions, we need to start getting of our island.  (hcderaad,
    13:03:51)
  * it’s not enough to expect only a small handful of people to do all
    the PR when everyone has their own social media accounts and can
    echo the newsposts being put out without much effort.  (hcderaad,
    13:03:52)

* Hotel reservations  (hcderaad, 13:12:33)
  * We’ve had some problems with the hotel reservations for the Van der
    Valk hotel and the sleep over facilities at the conference.
    (hcderaad, 13:12:34)
  * We’re straightening that out right now and will communicate about
    this this week.  (hcderaad, 13:12:36)

* Other points by participants?  (hcderaad, 13:21:15)
  * LINK: https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/schedule
    (hcderaad, 13:22:04)
  * The SUSE bus is leaving NUE at 11 a.m. on 04.30. It should be there
    by 9 or 10 p.m.  (hcderaad, 13:31:35)

* Next meeting  (hcderaad, 13:36:43)
