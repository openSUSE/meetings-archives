<a name="l-2"></a><span class="tm">15:03:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> Meeting started Wed Mar  4 15:03:15 2015 UTC.  The chair is robjo. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.

<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">15:03:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Hello everyone and welcome to the openSUSE project meeting
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The, unfortunately empty agenda, can be found here: https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Project_meeting
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> As far as I know there were no outstanding action items from the last meeting.
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:07:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Thus lets jump right in, does anyone have any topics they would like to discuss?
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> is not around AFAIK, thus he cannot provide an update on the meeting time poll
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:09:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> meeting time seems alright to me.   It's not the middle of the night here.
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:09:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The not so great news this week was the we did not get accepted as a mentoring organization for GSoC 15 :(
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> there have been like 60 organizations less this year
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;victorhck&gt;</span> would be good  to know the reasons for that...
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> AFAIK we will find out why in the next couple of weeks
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;victorhck&gt;</span> ok...
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:10:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The LinuxFoundation did not get accepted this year either
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> It looks to me that a number of organizations that were consistently accepted in the past did not make the cut this year
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Anyway, no need to speculate why, we'll get answers from Google soon enough and I am certain they will be shared on the list
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:12:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">oSC15</span>
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> A few words about oSC15
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I sent a mail to the -project list and want to do a short repeat here
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If you have any opportunity to promote oSC15 please use it, we need more attendees
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:14:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Also if you are a contributor and have not registered please make an effort to come to oSC
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Extra TSP money is available and the TSP application period is open
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:15:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SFaulken&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I'm registered, just waiting for an answer back from TSP
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SFaulken:</span> great

<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:17:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The Hotel situation is also sorting itself out, We will have "indoor" camping option at the event location.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> That's about all the news I have for oSC15, anyone else would like to chime in?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> I will be publishing an article related to the TSP and the visa requirements on news this week
