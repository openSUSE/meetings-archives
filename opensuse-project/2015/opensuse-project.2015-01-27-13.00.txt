* Current status proposed talks and tracks  (hcderaad, 13:01:44)
  * There haven’t been a lot of new additions, we now have 27 proposed
    talks  (hcderaad, 13:01:46)
  * This is obviously not enough to fill 4 rooms with high quality
    talks, we (robined and hcderaad) want to formalise internally that
    we keep the amount of talk rooms limited to 2 and add 1 devroom and
    1 workshop/tutorial room. This will be our goal.  (hcderaad,
    13:01:47)
  * If more talks are proposed at a later time, we can always expand
    this.  (hcderaad, 13:01:49)
  * Talks committee will all attend FOSDEM, we’ll start formalising the
    currently registered talks there so that we can start announcing
    them.  (hcderaad, 13:01:52)

* Invited speakers status  (hcderaad, 13:12:28)
  * Last weekend hcderaad attended phpBenelux conf and local meetups,
    invited 4 speakers to do talks.  (hcderaad, 13:12:30)
  * 2 already confirmed (talks about Docker security and about Ansible).
    (hcderaad, 13:12:31)
  * 2 others will probably have to be through video channel  (hcderaad,
    13:12:33)
  * There are some outstanding invites, hcderaad has done followup on
    them by email.  (hcderaad, 13:12:34)
  * NLUUG, NLLGG and some local meetups have been requested to spread
    the word about the CfP as well. hcderaad will do follow up on this
    after FOSDEM.  (hcderaad, 13:12:36)
  * keynote announced  (hcderaad, 13:12:37)

* Current status attendance registration  (hcderaad, 13:16:35)
  * The counter is now at 43 participants. That’s not very good.
    (hcderaad, 13:16:37)
  * We need to make an announcement about all current project members
    inviting colleagues/friends/etc/etc….  (hcderaad, 13:16:38)
  * Will talk in person about this at FOSDEM, as discussion in the IRC
    sessions and ML doesnt seem to provide much result.  (hcderaad,
    13:16:40)

* Promotion on events (FOSDEM/Scale)  (hcderaad, 13:29:55)
  * Linux Magazine (NL - Dutch language) offered to give us some extra
    swag, and announce the conf.  (hcderaad, 13:29:56)
  * We didnt have feedback from other news outlets yet, we’ll (robined
    and hcderaad) do a follow up later this week.  (hcderaad, 13:29:58)
  * The social event on Saturday at FOSDEM should also be a nice place
    to get together and talk about the current status.  (hcderaad,
    13:29:59)

* Focus on call for team members  (hcderaad, 13:39:14)
  * We need more people! This is also something we will discuss at
    FOSDEM.  (hcderaad, 13:39:15)
  * LINK: https://en.opensuse.org/Conference_FAQ_2015   (hcderaad,
