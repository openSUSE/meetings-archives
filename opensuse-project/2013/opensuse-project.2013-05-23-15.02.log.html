<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:07:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> topic doesn't change... anyway
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> the artwork team has been working on some artwork tasks we need
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you are not op

<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:08:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> would you like to introduce your work so far?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:08:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> hmm during last two days I did some t-shirts proposals https://picasaweb.google.com/104830275042059445407/OSC13#5880937230406584146
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> We have to decide on the T-shirt design and color
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:09:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> for attendees &amp; volunteers
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:09:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> some are very different from each other and the main idea is to have different colors for Attended, Organization and Volunteers
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:09:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> t-shirt design is the designer decision
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> color should be something that no one else wears
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you can pick the volunteers out of the crowd
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:10:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> red for example?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:10:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I had no time to update all Organization templates to the Attendedd and Volunteer
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Red or Yellow
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> red, yellow, bright green
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> during this task I had another idea that could be brilhant and easy to implement
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> also can save some money for the conference
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:11:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whats the purpose of t-sirts for attendees?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and maybe instead of organization write something like "Volunteer'
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:11:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> offer them a t-shirt of the conference
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> you disagree with that ?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> instead of have different tshirts for org, volunteers and attended we can use the same t-shirt + capitans sign
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> for moneys?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> i mean , that think that soccer capitain player use
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> as part of the conf bag content
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't see the purpose of that then :)
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I see
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:12:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> https://www.google.com.br/search?safe=off&amp;q=faixa+de+capitao+futebol&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46751780,d.dmg&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=506&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=mEqdUdX6Dorp0AHXiIDgBw
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> most people can't wear them, because they can't wash them at oSC13
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> oSC13 shirts make little sense (for us) after oSC13 is done
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:13:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> then we can use the same t-shirt with different "arm-thing" for org and volunteers
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I always like it when I take a t-shirt as a remember-gift from  confs...
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> what do you think ?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:13:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> having some conf t-shirts for sale might be a good idea
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> my thought is that we should have a conference t-shirt
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> If we plan on a reasonably low rate of sale, lets say 20% of attendees will buy one if they are reasonably priced
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:13:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> many people wear them at place
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> see Fosdem for example
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;victorhck&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> is on GitHub?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:14:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> sure. everyone like stuff for free
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:14:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the question is whether we will get a reasonable production cost if we only make 100 or 150 shirts, and they are sold they are sold, too bad for those coming late ;)
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> many ppl fight for t-shirts ehehe I believe t-shirts for selling, for giveaway, to help during talks... is a good thing
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> the question is not if they like it the question is what we get out of it :)
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">victorhck:</span> yes it is
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;victorhck&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">victorhck:</span> https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Events/openSUSE%20Conference/2013/T-shirts
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;victorhck&gt;</span> ok ;)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:15:28 </span><span class="nka">* Ilmehtar</span> <span class="ac">is half here, work is very busy right now</span>
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:15:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> what about post-conf visibility, a bit as in promo for next year since this is a yearly event
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think we get to promote our conference after the conference
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> that doesn't make sense
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:16:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> people wear thosekind of stuff in other places too
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> people at the conference obviously don't need to be promoted to about the conference :)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think      it does
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> t-shirts are a good promotion item, but we have a free conference and giving away t-shirts is most likely too expensive
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it's not
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I think the idea is to promote the conference to others by wearing the t-shirt at places later on throughout the rest of the year until next event
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:17:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it just doesn't make much sense :)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:17:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  we have the 'expensive' part really well covered :D
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:17:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> just for the record it's 4.1 euro per t-shirt
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:17:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> which also means you can't really wear them a year ;)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> or sth around that, depending on teh design and total number obviously
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I'll state the question differently... If we have the budget for it, would you like to give a t-shirt as a gift to attendees ?
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:19:00 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">don't</span>
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> agree with henne, the ultra cheap shirts are often "worn out" after going through the washer a few times
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:19:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> the quality is tested btw
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:19:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sell them for  buying price + 1€
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:19:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> give them as special gift
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:19:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> some of you have Summercamp t-shirts, right?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> don't throw them into the bag
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> same quality
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> well they won't actually be in the bag literally for practical reasons (size)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:20:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> they can be at the reg desk (or near it)
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> it could go on thes ame idea of osc11 actually
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:21:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> imo t-shirts have different meaning for different kind of ppl, example for us that have may have tons of t-shirts from older events we did, maybe is not good idea to have another one, but for newcomers, new ppl, visitor in general. I believe t-shirts must be present
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I like t-shirts from conferences, I have a lot of them and I wear them. But again, I'd rather spend the $1500 euros on helping someone else get to the conference than to give every attendee a free t-shirt
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:21:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> you can take a free t-shirt and donate whatever you like
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> +1 for kostas comments that give us a example of FOSDEM
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> those we're paid for t-shirts, not from the oSC budget
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:22:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also people also wear t-shirts from summit
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:22:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yeah yeah... I am only mentioning it as the concept of donation
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:22:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we wanted to get rid of them to be able to get new ones :)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> true. the travel support committee can comment on that - if they need money to bring people becasue as far as I am concerned they don't and have enough
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:22:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> nobody is disputing that t-shirts are great. the arguments are for or against us giving them away :)
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:23:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:23:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> also t-shirts could be a nice way to help us to make the audience to interact making questions during of ater talks
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:24:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> in Fosdem I had that talk about T-shirts
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it turns out that there are people who really like them and wear them
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:24:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and there are people who don't really care
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:24:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there are people who like to honk donkeys :)
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:24:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there are all kinds of people
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:24:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we think that
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> as like I said different ppl different meaning for t-shirts
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:25:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it would make sence to give them away
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> for us
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how long can we defer this?
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:26:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> don't know really :D
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:26:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it might be something we could do once we are sure the budget holds

<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:26:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the fact is that we have those in our Budget
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> ok so the ideas is to either give t-shirts away for free or to sell them at sth around  5 euro (since they cost around 4)
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:27:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and to defer that decision to later
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:27:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would propose

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:29:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 to that
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:29:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> so *if* we make attendee t-shirts, we will keep the same 1 single design for the t-shirts, is that what you are proposing?
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:29:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> so we need to have the same design or the same t-shirt ?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:29:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:30:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> he says that we have one for ALL volunteers
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> same t-shirt same color same everthing for volunteer, organization
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:30:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and if the budget allows one for attendants
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:30:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  ama I right?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:30:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> completely different t-shirts for organizers/volunteers and attendants
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:31:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> they have a completely different purpose
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the one for organizers is to pick them out of a crowd, give them authority
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:31:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the one for attendees is about promotion of oSC13 afterwards
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:31:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or rahter promotion of oSC
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ahmmm ok, so now that I understood i can reply... yes i agree with you, we must decide the best design and use in all t-shirts
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> just changing colors in my opinion
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway. propose something. we can talk about this offline

<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">16:11:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> There have been some ideas about this:
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">16:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> 1. make a4 page (many people opposed to have the program printed in that page, but that's not the issue at this moment)
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">16:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> 2. have something smaller / A5
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">16:12:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> there was also an idea to put a personal QR code  on them
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">16:12:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> (this idea came up in case people like sponsors want some kind of a list of attendees or sth, which is problematic for obvious reasons. Whereas using a QR code they can scan whomever attendee wants to be scanned)
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">16:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> The problem at hand at this moment is
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">16:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> that the artwork people must produce a design, which guidelines are not clear yet.
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">16:13:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what's wrong with buttons?
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">16:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">16:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> buttons with a name, irc handle -&gt; done
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">16:14:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">16:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we still have a gazillion buttons left
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">16:14:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> from oSC11
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">16:14:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> don't really like that
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">16:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> well the idea was initially to put the program, then it changed into putting at least the very important info (such as emergency phone numbers, party address etc)
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">16:14:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> did not liked that on oSC11 also :D
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">16:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> me neighter
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">16:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I liked it
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">16:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> but I still prepfer to have the imoprtant info there
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> printing too much of that buttons was wasting money in my opinion
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I think that is something that should go on the back of the program
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">16:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the name tag should be a name tag
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">16:15:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> easy wearable
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:15:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> we should have the program in the name badge
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> that was cool
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that personalizes the program
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">16:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I say let's stck to what was made on oSC12
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and makes it impossible to update
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> true but there are realistic problems that were raised in ML (I think) from a couple of people and are true. Such as the accuracy of the program
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:16:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> printed programs suck hairy balls
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:16:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> we can have the program printed in one side and the nametag in other sheet
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:16:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:16:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> and just have both on the same holder
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> My argument is about other important information, emergency numbers, mobile no, addresses
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> if people only have to wear their lanyard to have ALL that info gathered into one place
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">16:17:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> the one of oSC12 did not get good feedback, this year I would go with single side card with name and nickname
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:17:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> the rest of the info were in printed papers in the registration desk
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tampakrap:</span> +1
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> along with the schedule
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">16:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tampakrap:</span>  that is not a bad idea
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">16:17:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> so the info in the badge was useless
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">16:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the rest of the info I want to have available at all times
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">16:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> tampakrap, who said it was not good?
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">16:17:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> people around
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">16:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> i organized oSC12 btw
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">16:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that means I want to have a stack of that stuff somewhere I can grab it
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">16:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> and I came with the idea of the badge
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">16:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> not one on the back of my nametag
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">16:18:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> and to be clear, they didn't say it was not good
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">16:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> tampakrap, I thought it was great :)
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">16:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> they said that the info was useless
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">16:18:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well we could go bothways
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">16:18:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> what bothways?!
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">16:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> especially the schedule got deprecated the same day we printed it due to last minute changes
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">16:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> why not see what is cheaper and get over with it
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">16:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">16:19:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> cheapest using buttons ;)
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">16:19:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> how many spare badges?
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">16:19:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as we have buttons ;)
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">16:19:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I mean it is too much of conversation for something not that important
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">16:19:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> buttons? enough. way enough
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">16:19:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Amey_India&gt;</span> and a small bunch of paper to write down quick notes would be helpful...
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">16:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> buttons need time to get done
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">16:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a whole cardboard box full
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">16:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> ok then, clearly this is the cheapest way to go
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">16:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but needs time
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">16:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> either buttons, or a single side card (or double side card with the same info in both sides) with just name, nickname and name of the conf, no need to fold stuff, no need to put extra effort to prepare them
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">16:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 tampakrap
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">16:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">16:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> does this mean we do NOT want to have lanyards either ?
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">16:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> if there are going to be buttons then no lanyards
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">16:20:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">16:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> we had problems last year with those as well, they ran away
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">16:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> single card = buttons
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">16:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> same info
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">16:21:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what else can one use?
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">16:21:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if we have buttons, no if we do not have buttons yea
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">16:21:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> stickers?
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">16:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> we don't want lanyards =&gt; we go to buttons, we do want lanyards =&gt; we go to card badge
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">16:21:40 </span><span class="nka">* warlordfff</span> <span class="ac">confused</span>
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">16:21:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but don't pay attention
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">16:21:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> stickers for what henne ?
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">16:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tampakrap&gt;</span> the question is the other way round: we want buttons =&gt; no lanyards, we don't want buttons =&gt; we go with cards + lanyards
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">16:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> https://www.google.de/search?q=hello+my+name+is&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FEKeUZu5Ocmz4AS2j4DQDA&amp;ved=0CC4QsAQ&amp;biw=1866&amp;bih=1067

<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">16:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> no I don't want stickers
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">16:22:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> they get unsticked all the time
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">16:22:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> and ruined afterwards
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">16:22:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok me neither actually but it is cool
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">16:22:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> the button or card-badge I can keep
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">16:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but you can have 100 just for yourself :)
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">16:22:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I only want one :)
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">16:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> and a couple of conf stickers :P
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">16:23:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> maybe one rround with a geeko head
<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">16:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you don't like them because you can't bring them home?

<a name="l-509"></a><span class="tm">16:23:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> let's nto talk about the conf stickers now

<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">16:23:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">16:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> no I don't like them because they get ruined easily
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">16:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Can we agree that 2 or 3 people should make a decision on the badge issue and get on with the show?
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">16:23:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think most of the people throw them anyway
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">16:24:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> in any case it is extremely important that we decide really soon.

<a name="l-704"></a><span class="tm">16:50:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we can have delivery
<a name="l-705"></a><span class="tm">16:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> because there is no volunteer that can barbecue in July in Greece for 4 straight days
<a name="l-706"></a><span class="tm">16:50:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is possible
<a name="l-707"></a><span class="tm">16:50:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I mean delivery
<a name="l-708"></a><span class="tm">16:51:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> pizzas and gyrros
<a name="l-709"></a><span class="tm">16:51:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if you want to have the spirit of oSC11

<a name="l-711"></a><span class="tm">16:51:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-712"></a><span class="tm">16:51:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I cant barbecue on july either
<a name="l-713"></a><span class="tm">16:51:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tian2992&gt;</span> melting hazard
<a name="l-714"></a><span class="tm">16:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think we should ask for volunteers on that
<a name="l-715"></a><span class="tm">16:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> go talk to the nearest bakery and order sandwiches to be picked up in the mornin
<a name="l-716"></a><span class="tm">16:52:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok can I have 1?
<a name="l-717"></a><span class="tm">16:52:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I have some doubts about the paying process for that...
<a name="l-718"></a><span class="tm">16:52:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> how so?
<a name="l-719"></a><span class="tm">16:52:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the idea is to have fresh coffe/tea and cookies everyday
<a name="l-720"></a><span class="tm">16:52:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  bakeries don't accept credit cards and they dont issue invoices to buyers outside of greece
<a name="l-721"></a><span class="tm">16:53:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have that cash problem
<a name="l-722"></a><span class="tm">16:53:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> as far as I understand invoicing to suse is a prerequisite if they are going to pay for something
<a name="l-723"></a><span class="tm">16:53:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yes what warlordfff said
<a name="l-724"></a><span class="tm">16:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have cash
<a name="l-725"></a><span class="tm">16:53:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm
<a name="l-726"></a><span class="tm">16:53:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we == openSUSE
<a name="l-727"></a><span class="tm">16:53:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> seriously?
<a name="l-728"></a><span class="tm">16:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and I'm sure people will front us money
<a name="l-729"></a><span class="tm">16:54:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes we have cash left from oSC11
<a name="l-730"></a><span class="tm">16:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I mean seriously you can come with 2000 euro and pay in cash for stuff ?
<a name="l-731"></a><span class="tm">16:54:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not the idea we have so far henne
<a name="l-732"></a><span class="tm">16:54:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and like I've said, you only have to cover potential losses anyway
<a name="l-733"></a><span class="tm">16:54:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> and you don't need an invoice for that?
<a name="l-734"></a><span class="tm">16:54:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> maybe we could find some specialized sponsor that help us with this. A professional cooking, a bakery something like that
<a name="l-735"></a><span class="tm">16:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> (I don't mean receipt, I mean invoice to suse)
<a name="l-736"></a><span class="tm">16:54:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span>  impossible, we have a crisis you know :D
<a name="l-737"></a><span class="tm">16:54:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> go to the nearest bakery tell them you want to have 60 assorted sandwiches for July 18, 08:00
<a name="l-738"></a><span class="tm">16:55:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ask them for the price and that's all the money you need
<a name="l-739"></a><span class="tm">16:55:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait
<a name="l-740"></a><span class="tm">16:55:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> there is the idea
<a name="l-741"></a><span class="tm">16:55:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you sell the sandwiches for +50¢
<a name="l-742"></a><span class="tm">16:55:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> of having coffee/tea and cookies every morning
<a name="l-743"></a><span class="tm">16:55:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> free
<a name="l-744"></a><span class="tm">16:55:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> next day you go back with the money you've taken in and get the next badge
<a name="l-745"></a><span class="tm">16:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> 60 sandwitches to feed people ? :/
<a name="l-746"></a><span class="tm">16:56:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> isnt it a bit low ?
<a name="l-747"></a><span class="tm">16:56:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that's of course not everything...
<a name="l-748"></a><span class="tm">16:56:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but that's how you pay for stuff if you run your own event
<a name="l-749"></a><span class="tm">16:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I bet you the bakery will also let you sell on commission
<a name="l-750"></a><span class="tm">16:57:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> there is a problem here
<a name="l-751"></a><span class="tm">16:57:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> which is also the solution
<a name="l-752"></a><span class="tm">16:58:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we will have the venue caffe bar open
<a name="l-753"></a><span class="tm">16:58:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so they can actually cover that
<a name="l-754"></a><span class="tm">16:58:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> again talking about just cold sandwitches at attendee's expense
<a name="l-755"></a><span class="tm">16:59:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we can ask for more I think during the conferenc
<a name="l-756"></a><span class="tm">16:59:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> e
<a name="l-757"></a><span class="tm">16:59:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so do that
<a name="l-758"></a><span class="tm">16:59:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what about that?
<a name="l-759"></a><span class="tm">16:59:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we don't have to feed people
<a name="l-760"></a><span class="tm">16:59:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-761"></a><span class="tm">16:59:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> food just needs to be available at a reasonable price
<a name="l-762"></a><span class="tm">16:59:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1000
<a name="l-763"></a><span class="tm">16:59:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and again, If you want to have the feeling that this is your event, make it yourself :)
<a name="l-764"></a><span class="tm">16:59:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> my point exactly
<a name="l-765"></a><span class="tm">17:00:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-766"></a><span class="tm">17:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> some of our sponsors could not sponsor one night? like sponsors dinner, sponsors meal and we open another window to get money and support
<a name="l-767"></a><span class="tm">17:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the idea so far is
<a name="l-768"></a><span class="tm">17:00:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> quite sure Hans do that

<a name="l-778"></a><span class="tm">17:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 2-3 euro most
