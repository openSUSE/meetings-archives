<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Initial impression is good from my part, share henne's concern that we will probably need more rooms for BoF's also customarily there is a press-room
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:27:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> 2000 km henné
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:27:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and you will need like 5 euros for a cab from any hotel or 10-15 minutes top by bus
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whats the situation around the venue? can you shop, get food, public transportation etc?
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  henne we are working on more rooms for BoFs
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:28:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  yeap

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:28:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> less than 100m from the venue you can have it all
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:29:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also delivery food is pretty popular so we could give orders in the venue, we will have someone for this :D
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> next topic?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> keynote speakers
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:29:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay my strong suggestion would be to draw the venue including all the info and pictures
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:30:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I will try to make something up
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:30:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it's good to have a visual overview
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> or find someone to do it, or aske from the venue to give me something
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:30:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but I will need some time
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:30:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:30:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> since I cannot exactly move right now
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:31:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I hope I will have it all by Fosdem the latest
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:31:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> all the stuff related with the venue , public transport and usefull info it will be included in the Android Application :)
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:31:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> about osc13 i mean
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:31:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes the question is if it's there :)
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:32:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whatever we do with it
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:32:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay do we have anything else @venue?
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:32:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok I believe I will have everything covered
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok lets go to the keynote speakers
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">15:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> make that Program in general
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">15:33:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> first of all who you think should handle Keynote speakers?
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">15:33:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the program committee of course
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the program committee would like to punt on the keynote speaker chase
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I am here
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> cool differentreality
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so you might want to take over this topic?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">15:34:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> why is that?
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">15:35:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> because it is an almost fulltime job to deal with the keynote speaker
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">15:35:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> huh?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">15:35:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> did not object in e-mail when I proposed this to committee
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">15:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> For a keynote speaker we have to find the person we want deal with travel arrangements etc. etc.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">15:36:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you mean that keynote speakers should get special treatment in regards to travel etc?
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">15:37:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I would think they do, will make it easier to find someone outside the community if we want that
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">15:38:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if we stay within the community "special" treatment may not be necessary
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">15:38:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but this can be handled by the people who care for travel arrangements. the travel support people
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">15:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think that this is a Job for...
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">15:38:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> jospoortvliet:
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:38:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> at least if I got it right
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap I think travel arrangments(meaning reimburshment) can be done by the Travel Support
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">15:39:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sec, reading up on the thread
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">15:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ...
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">15:40:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think the larger team (this group) should decide what kind of keynote we want, and then someone, maybe jospoortvliet, can actively go an try an recruit a speaker.
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">15:40:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure, sounds good
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">15:40:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> +1 on that
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">15:41:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay then let's decide right here, right now on what kind of keynote(s) we want to have :)
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">15:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> maybe first how many keynotes we want
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">15:41:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it would be nice to bring people that are actively involved with the openSUSE at some point like Alan Clark and Greg KH...
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">15:42:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think we need a strong opening keynote, if we want keynotes for other days than the first we might recruit from within
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">15:42:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> following my suggestion for the program to have kind of "special topic" days
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">15:42:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I would like to see 3 keynotes
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">15:42:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">15:43:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">15:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> one opening keynote about the project, one about the distribution and one about the infrastructure
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">15:43:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I would make the opening keynote independent of the topic day
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">15:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> both ways are great actually
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">15:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> why?
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">15:44:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 4 keynotes then, one for the event as a hole, on for the project, the distribution, and  infrastructure respectively
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">15:45:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'd like to see a keynote that addresses the event as a whole and generates some excitement right of the get go.
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">15:45:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm, I would say to make the openSUSE Project meeting the keynote for the 4th day, just thinking
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">15:45:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hm but that would mean you have 2 tentative keynotes...
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">15:46:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> not so good for swallowing what was said
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:46:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> how did you get from 4 to 2?
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">15:46:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> 3 days, 4 keynotes
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">15:46:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we talked about 4 days
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> means one day we must have 2 :)
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we have days, at least that's what my fingers say, Fr, Sa, Su, Mo
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> osc13 dates-18 soft, 19-21 hard, 22 soft
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:47:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> from our last meeting
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">15:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I would suggest to have at least the opening keynote by a (relatively) well known person who can generate some excitement, say something that people will talk about.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">15:47:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> as agreed during last meeting we will have a 4-day event (Fri - Mon). I could see us having 4 keynotes for each day + closing + opening presentations
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">15:47:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> interesting person from outside, not even per-se a free software person
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">15:47:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> erm STOP
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">15:47:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we could have a keynote speak in the first day though
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">15:47:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and have the other keynotes closer to 'openSUSE'
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">15:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-project/2012/opensuse-project.2012-12-13-15.04.html
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">15:48:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">says:</span> AGREED: osc13 dates-18 soft, 19-21 hard, 22 soft
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">15:48:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 22 soft does not imply we cannot have a keynote
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">15:48:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> but the keynote might not have super much attendance
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">15:48:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I would beg to differ :)
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:48:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> henne is imho right :D
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:49:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> soft means hangout
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:49:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so I'll help him begging
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:49:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> But implies that the keynote on the last day will be, ..., not well
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> true, but still we will run the event on Monday, we will just not go until 18:00 - or at least this is what I thought was the idea of everybody during last meeting
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:49:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> have fun
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:49:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> correct, but if it is a topic keynote such as infrastructure we would not expect as many people as I would for a general opening keynote anyway
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:50:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> sure, but then it's much more like a talk
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">15:50:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> infra doesn't sound soft :-D
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">15:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> IMHO it would work to have an opening keynote on the opening party
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">15:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">15:50:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the topic keynotes will be more like talks, yes
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">15:50:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> But not sure about famous guy
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">15:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> that's a nice idea
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">15:50:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> If we can get a rock-star speaker it would actually be a very large incentive to fly in early
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">15:50:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> As attandance might be quite low
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">15:51:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> problem is that ppl will be coming in and going out all the time, I suppose. But yeah, it might work
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">15:51:08 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">likes that idea</span>
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">15:51:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> me too
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">15:51:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> what do others think of a rockstar spreaker on the opening night?
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">15:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Not sure if we will get enough people, but otherwise I'm all for it
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">15:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> not in favor of having opening keynote and "pre-party" mixed
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">15:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> if he/she spreak correctly, and play drums or guitar I'm+
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">15:52:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> why?
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">15:52:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> talk at 19:00, party starts at 20:00 :D
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">15:52:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> lol
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">15:52:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> same argument you just made about Monday being soft
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">15:52:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ops
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">15:52:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> party at 20:00
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">15:52:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">15:52:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> hmmm
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">15:52:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">15:52:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> cannot have it both ways ;)
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:52:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> party at 22:00
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> guys, don't mix so many topics
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">15:53:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> at 20:00 it will be too hot and too early for an actual party
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:53:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if Monday is too "soft" to have a keynote then pre-event evening is certainly too soft as well.
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:53:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok I am back
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:53:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:54:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> if we don't put a keynote on Monday though, maybe that will be an incentive for people to actually leave earlier? (Just like keynote on Thrusday can be incentive to fly in earlier?)
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:54:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Well, first day people are still fresh and eager to listen
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">15:54:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so how many keynote speakers?
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">15:54:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> well we WANT people to come early, as in, not arrive on the 19th. Doing something very cool the evening before is at least more sensible than the day after. Still, you have a point there. Maybe then simply the traditional opening keynote then as a big one
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">15:54:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> we are discussing that...
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">15:54:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">15:55:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> Monday is not the day after, Tuesday is the day after
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">15:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> sorry
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">15:55:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> yeah have dates mixed up on my head
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">15:55:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we expect people to leave on Monday during the day, but not on SUnday
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">15:55:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay it seems to me we need to agree what Soft-Days are
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">15:55:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Monday it will be our last day at the venue
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">15:55:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I thought we have but obviously we all have different ideas
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">15:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> our idea and what we talked with the venue people:
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">15:56:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 18 we have the venue but not the rooms, monday we have the rooms and the venue
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">15:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am fine with having a keynote on the 18, but then we need to make that day a part of the conference and advertise accordingly
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">15:56:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> first day is 19 right? that's a friday
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">15:56:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap jospoortvliet
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">15:56:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> my understanding is that osc happens 19-22   (on the 18th is pre-registration party etc, sth cool would be nice as per jos suggestion).
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">15:56:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> i,e, oSC13 Jul 18-22
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">15:56:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> 18 soft day, 22 soft day
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">15:57:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> with 18 has a published program of "keynote", "partY"
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">15:57:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 18 is just for registration party
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">15:57:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> gah people
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">15:57:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you can have understandings all you want
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">15:57:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we agreed on something
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">15:57:24 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">imagines henne now looking tired at the screen</span>
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">15:57:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can we stick to that? :)
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">15:57:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> otherwise we have to re-agree all the time
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">15:57:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> it seems to me that not everybody understood the same thing by what we agreed :/
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">15:58:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> as I said before
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">15:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 18 we have the venue but not the rooms, monday we have the rooms and the venue
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">15:58:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> everybody understood that?
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">15:58:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> soft days means days people come and leave so no official program, just hackin'. exception is first soft day with pre-reg evening party. correct?
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">15:58:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the question now is: what is a soft day
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">15:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so actually first day(meaning talks) is 19th
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">15:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We agreed that we would have a party on the evening before (18th) and have a full program Fr, Sa, Su with a "soft" program Mo as we expect people to leave. At least that is my recollection.
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">15:59:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the first sof day is just for registration party
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">15:59:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> this was totally *not* my understanding from last meeting
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">15:59:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay then let's talk about soft days
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">15:59:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> I guess everyone is confused with names hard and soft days. Why don't erase those and use the exact days instead?
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">15:59:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what do people expect?
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">15:59:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> yet what I said seems to fit with what robjo and warlordfff say so there's a problem somewhere :D
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">16:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I expect no program, only activities
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">16:00:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:00:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I think that's not what robjo says... or am I wrong ?
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:00:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> like pre-opening party, key signing party
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:00:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> BoFs
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:00:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a tour of the city
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">16:00:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the project meeting
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">16:01:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The project meeting should be on one of the main days, we want as many people there as possible.
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">16:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> details. what do you understand as "soft-day"
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">16:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> W 8
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">16:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> only that people leave?
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">16:02:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lets leave vuntz talk :D
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">16:02:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> i would expect a soft day as being one in which people arrive or leave, so the events taking place aren't important to the core conference experience.
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">16:02:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> ignore me :-)
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">16:02:27 </span><span class="nka">* znggo</span> <span class="ac">goes back to lurking</span>
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">16:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">16:02:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so our idea is
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">16:03:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> at the 18th we only have registration party
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">16:03:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> at 22 we have talks that are not that important
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">16:03:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that is what I and stella got from the last meeting
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">16:03:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how do you define talks that are not important?
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">16:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I wouldn't do that. it's insulting
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">16:04:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeah, stupid choice of words
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">16:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I don't think we can tell in advance if talks will be important or non important or whatever
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">16:04:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">16:04:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> point is 22 (monday) has talks
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">16:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> worst its discouraging to have a talk planned on that day...
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">16:04:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> expert talk in fact ;-)
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">16:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so what is the difference between a regular day and a soft-day
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">16:04:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> with less less ppl
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">16:04:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> we also aknowldge the fact that people might want to leave at some point on Monday (so doesnt make sense to have the talks go until 6-7pm)
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">16:05:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> a bit earlier closing I would say for Monday
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">16:05:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> so the difference between a soft-day and a regular day is how long the day goes?
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">16:05:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> tell them to stay, and only leave Tuesday.
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">16:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I would have the Monday just as a hacking day. So no talks, no planned schedule, just the rooms, chairs, people.
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">16:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> this is what was proposed in the previous meeting. That people want to leave Monday evening
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">16:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hacking has to happen at some point and Monday seems good for that, right?
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">16:06:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">16:06:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> not really. we talked about soft-program
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">16:06:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> anything you plan will be in trouble as some people will not be there
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">16:06:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'll go back to my earlier proposal:
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">16:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> 4 keynotes then, one for the event as a hole, on for the project, the distribution, and  infrastructure respectively
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">16:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> The topic keynotes are more like talks, with the exception that they are the only thing on the schedule.
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">16:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We get a "rockstar" speaker for the conference opening keynote and recruit from within for the topic keynotes
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">16:07:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> people if you don't ride out the topic we discuss, we'll never get anywhere
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">16:07:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> one thing at a time
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">16:07:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> and some people will already leave on Sunday
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">16:07:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> but very few
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">16:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have 2 ideas of soft-days now
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">16:08:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 1. it is shorter but otherwise the same
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">16:08:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 2. it has no scheduled program only group activities
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">16:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> which one are we going for?
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">16:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I vote 2
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">16:08:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> +1 for 2nd
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">16:09:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> +1 for 2nd
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">16:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nikhatzi&gt;</span> i vote 2nd too
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">16:09:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> what if we get enough talks to fill 4 days, are you willing to tell all those that would be on day 4 that they cannot talk
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">16:09:42 </span><span class="nka">* |miska|</span> <span class="ac">votes for 2 as well</span>
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">16:09:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> they can do whatever they want. on their account
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">16:09:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'd like to accept as many proposals as possible
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">16:10:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">16:10:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> 2nd
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">16:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> sorry, they either get accepted or not that is not "on their account"
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">16:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Didn't worked well last year
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">16:10:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I would go for quality over quantity. A MAJOR complaint of the conference last year was: too many talks
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">16:10:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah, 3 days talks is way enough
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">16:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, fine with me
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">16:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> this implies that you can expect people to leave on Sunday as it turns out to be "the last day of the event"
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">16:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that depends on the activities that happen on the soft-days
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">16:12:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> what about we have 4-day event, 3 days talks, 4th day one rock-star speaker &amp; the rest of the day activities/hacking (what jos said)
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">16:12:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would say
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">16:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we will make a program on monday, it just won't be talks, just hacking
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">16:12:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and fun stuff
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">16:12:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> hacking is also important for the community
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">16:12:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> henne: exactly.
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">16:13:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, back to the keynotes then?
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">16:13:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay are we in agreement about soft-days?
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">16:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> make sure monday is attactive but it won't kill in terms of content if you to leave during the afternoon :D
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">16:13:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap, if we are all clear on the soft days lets proceed
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">16:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Soft days are days without a scheduled program, only group activities
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">16:13:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> make use of #agreed

<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">16:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so back to keynotes
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">16:15:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so jospoortvliet are you going to handle finding keynote speakers?
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">16:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> if you tell me WHAT keynote speakers yes
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">16:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> you haven't done that yet
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">16:16:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> so how would you do then opening keynote?
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">16:16:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> s/then/the/
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">16:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'd have a keynote about FOSS and community and community building to start the event
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">16:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> like?
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">16:17:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> then I'd follow that with a short break and a talk on the topic for the opening day
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">16:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> if we have that, we can leave the "Project" keynote be
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">16:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as this is already inspiring for that topic
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">16:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> this talk is not competing with anything else, such it is like a keynote
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">16:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">16:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'm good with tha
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">16:18:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> then the first day should be "community day"
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">16:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> as "theme for the day"
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">16:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> any ideas on whom will that be?
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">16:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> M Miller is a good idea, I really liked his talk in NUE
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">16:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think John "Maddog" Hall would be great, but that is probably dreaming....
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">16:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I can ask him.
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">16:19:37 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">falls asleep</span>
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">16:20:03 </span><span class="nka">* henne</span> <span class="ac">would like to see someone talk about friendship in the greek mythology</span>
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">16:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> something inspiring
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">16:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Doc Searls ?
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">16:20:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I know him well enough that I think he'll come (I've seen him in swiming gear, hehe) but I don't know how good a speaker he is :D
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">16:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> not some old dude talking about stuff from the seventies ;)
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">16:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> that was about john
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">16:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> hehe
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">16:21:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> propose don't complain ;)
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">16:21:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but I'm a complainer ;)
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">16:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I don't think maddog could be a dreaming, maybe sending a mail to him could help to make this dream come true ;-)
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">16:21:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay we're drifting
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">16:22:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what I would like to hear opinions about is: is the first day as "community day" a problem?
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">16:22:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> What about Thomas Freidman, author of "The world is flat"
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">16:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not for me
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">16:22:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I have no problems with it
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyone has a problem with that?
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We could ask Jim Zemlin from the Linux FOundation
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">16:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if not I would say to propose some to jospoortvliet and then let him to do the rest of the work :D
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">16:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:23:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wht do you think?
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so that we will not hold that meeting forever
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> well henne thinks Maddog is a sleeper, thus just punting it to one person may not be the best approach
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">16:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I can try and do a decent job ;-)
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> but I'd love your help. How about we do this together?
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lets leave jospoortvliet to come with a few people and we decide in the next meeting
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> watch youtube video's of speakers etc
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> sorry, didn't mean it that way
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> it's OK
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:25:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> offer still stands, you know people and have a strong opinion so let's do it together
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:25:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> Linus TOvards?
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> Don't know if it's appropriate, what do you think about Jono Bacon?
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">16:25:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> we're looking for inspiring speakers, not folks who yell at you :D
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:25:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">diamond_gr:</span> I already proposed that a bit higher up :D
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:25:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:25:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we are especially looking for good speakers
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">16:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> so mark shuttleworth is right out, then?
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">16:25:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> not for people who are known
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">16:25:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">16:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">16:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but it helps if they are well known - attracts people.
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">16:25:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> I saw good from Richard Hughes about making ColorHug a reality, but we probably aim higher
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">16:25:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> hmmm I got the point, make sense
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">16:26:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> Freidmann is not an option, there's a conflict with my surname :-)
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">16:26:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I think we should spend at least 10% of the budget for the opening keynote
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">16:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so are we going to propose more people or let jospoortvliet and whom anybody else wants to help him to come with something that will present us in the next meeting?
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">16:27:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I mean literally pay someone to speak
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">16:27:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">16:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I fully agree
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">16:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> a good inspiring talk is a big plus for the whole session
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">16:28:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">16:28:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">16:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> +1 henne
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">16:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> as a matter of fact I wouldn't want to do the picking of a keynote speaker unless we pay for travel and hotel and give say 500 bucks for the trouble.
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">16:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> maddog with an ancient philo toga :-)
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">16:28:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> the 500 might not be strictly needed
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">16:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but it would help
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">16:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> hehehe he'd look like a philosopher
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">16:29:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> he's not a super prolific speaker but a nice guy and would attract some folk. But let's see what robjo and me can come up with, ok?
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">16:29:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also Greg KH could be a fine keynote speaker for the next days, just saying
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">16:29:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> let's at least be clear on the requirements: a relationship with FOSS and communities in the talk would be required, right?
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">16:29:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> robjo you get my trust for sure
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">16:29:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and we pay for hotel and travel and if needed a bit for the trouble
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">16:29:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also Ralf Flaaxa is a great speaker
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">16:29:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> well , i would suggest Ralf Flaxa as a keynote speaker
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">16:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> just request quotes from people :)
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">16:29:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> or Imad Sousou (from Intel)
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">16:29:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> hehe
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">16:29:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zoumpis:</span> No
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">16:30:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> +1, but avoid tax heaven :-)
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">16:30:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zoumpis:</span> Imad is not a good speaker
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">16:30:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> neither is Ralf
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">16:30:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway, we're drifintg
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">16:30:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok we agree that we disagree :D
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">16:30:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> do we need to do anything else regarding the keynote?
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">16:31:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not from me
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">16:31:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, so 1 opening keynote on Fr, this covers the whole event and Friday has the "community day" theme
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">16:31:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Sa &amp; SU keynotes for "distribution" and "infrastructure", not necessarily in this order
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">16:31:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Those speakers are recruited from within?
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">16:31:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">jospoortvliet to find keynote spekers and propose them in the next meeting</span>
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">16:31:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and you and jospoortvliet find the people for all 3
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">16:32:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'm OK with that
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">16:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok from me too
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">16:32:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">16:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> then lets move to artwork
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">16:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> actually that's Promotion
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">16:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">16:33:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  want to lead that?
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">16:33:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> please
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">16:33:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can do
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">16:33:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> on you then
<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">16:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we didn't really come to a conclusion on the theme/motto
<a name="l-508"></a><span class="tm">16:33:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it seems to me that the only artist who's doing stuff is Andi
<a name="l-509"></a><span class="tm">16:34:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and he started to go the ancient greek route
<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">16:34:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think "Power to the Geeko" was generally accepted
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">16:34:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> me too
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">16:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> if fact, Andi could find new fresh way :-)
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">16:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> although honestly I was confused on the motto
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">16:34:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> just submitted new ideas, and a proposal will be made ...
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">16:34:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> With an initial draft for artwork I am not certain we need to worry more about the "motto"
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">16:34:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but I love power to the Geeko
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">16:34:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no not really
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok then
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">16:35:02 </span><span class="nka">* |miska|</span> <span class="ac">gotta go, will read the rest later, bye</span>
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">16:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">16:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">16:35:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> bye |miska|
<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">16:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> let's see what Andi comes up with
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">16:35:27 </span><span class="nka">* victorhck</span> <span class="ac">must go too</span>
<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">16:35:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I'll work with him on the rest
<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">16:36:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i guess we'll end up with ancient greek
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">16:36:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> looks that way, lets just roll with it
<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">16:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> +1 henne
<a name="l-529"></a><span class="tm">16:36:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> other then that there has been no real progess
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">16:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap, and then make banners, counters and stuff
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">16:36:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because this is a blocking issue
<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">16:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> or a totally future build with old stones
<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">16:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> hm?
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">16:37:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> at least what's for sure, we need something to throw out at Fosdem
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">16:37:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> did anybody say how good we eat in thessaloniki ?
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">16:37:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> great food for cheap price
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">16:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> a small flyers, saying what (osc3), when, where, what you could expect ...
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">16:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> we really need something now.
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">16:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> dont forget to say this to all geeks lol
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">16:38:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we can't have something without artwork/theme
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">16:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I suggest we go with what we have and get more stuff drawn up around the two proposals Andi made
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">16:39:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> put a printer and the badge maker in the bus, warlordfff + zoumpis will print and build them from Nue to Bxl :-)
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">16:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> has already written up some stuff that fits with the proposed artwork, we are out of time and need to roll
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">16:39:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zoumpis&gt;</span> :) tigerfoot
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">16:39:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">16:39:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I guess we all know that we run out of time
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">16:40:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but we don't really have a designer at hand

<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">16:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and maybe CarlosRibeiro can come up with something
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">16:41:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> can we enlist Ken for a day?

<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">16:42:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> sure. It wouldn't look super perfect but really, without a logo there's nothing, with a logo - there's enough for the basics.
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">16:42:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> no problem for me
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">16:42:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and what robjo just said - we have other people including CarlosRibeiro who can do things far better than I can :D
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">16:42:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I've meant can we book Ken for a day

<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">16:45:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> lets find the logo and once we do it lets make the anouncements asap

<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">16:54:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> the one with the pilar had the issue of very much being related to Athens. The thinking geeko seems the best choice to me anyway, focus on that I'd say.
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">16:54:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it's perfect with greece and the stuff I wrote as example texts.
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">16:54:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1 with jospoortvliet
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">16:54:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> the joy and fun part - well, we can add a nice garden in the background later :D
<a name="l-614"></a><span class="tm">16:55:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> or put the logo on a beer mug :D

<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">16:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Im against rushing this
<a name="l-617"></a><span class="tm">16:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> how about a bath towel for all visitors with the thinking geeko...
<a name="l-618"></a><span class="tm">16:55:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> differentreality proposed one with the tower in the city =, I'd like to explore a third design with that in mind

<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">16:55:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok hehe

<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">16:56:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so go for the one jospoortvliet proposed I'd say
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">16:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> yes but rushing this through now doesn't make sense either
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">16:57:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I would rather announce only the CFP

<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">16:57:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so we can anounce a CfP without a logo, right?

<a name="l-682"></a><span class="tm">17:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so we also wan't to announce the whole conference
<a name="l-683"></a><span class="tm">17:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> without having secured the venue etc
<a name="l-684"></a><span class="tm">17:05:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> oSC13 announcement on the 23rd, CfP one week later on the 30th
<a name="l-685"></a><span class="tm">17:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> guys I'm telling you. we borke this because of perceived time issues
<a name="l-686"></a><span class="tm">17:05:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the world is going fast
<a name="l-687"></a><span class="tm">17:05:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> IMHO veue is only an issue of payment?
<a name="l-688"></a><span class="tm">17:05:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> needs to make certain they wait for our check ;)
<a name="l-689"></a><span class="tm">17:05:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if it's not payed it's not secured
<a name="l-690"></a><span class="tm">17:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yes and *probably* I will be able to confirm on the 22nd
<a name="l-691"></a><span class="tm">17:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> henne -- specially when you got kids
<a name="l-692"></a><span class="tm">17:06:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it's a lot of moving pieces and we're going to drop some
<a name="l-693"></a><span class="tm">17:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I don't think that it is realistic to expect that payment to venue (along with anything else that is involved before the payment, contract for example) within one week. Would be nice, but don't it will happen
<a name="l-694"></a><span class="tm">17:06:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> let's announce the CFP without the conference
<a name="l-695"></a><span class="tm">17:06:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well if SUSE agrees on the Venue then we will have the dates seured
<a name="l-696"></a><span class="tm">17:06:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> leaving now lol ... kiss to everybody I know
<a name="l-697"></a><span class="tm">17:07:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> yeah sounds very unrealistic
<a name="l-698"></a><span class="tm">17:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> so happy to join 2 passions ;-) greece end geeko
<a name="l-699"></a><span class="tm">17:07:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> venue is pretty much already keeping dates for us, I will call them to confirm that and let them know that we will soon have our sponsor in contact with them to arrange the details (that could take a while, but first of all we want that they keep the dates for us, right?)
<a name="l-700"></a><span class="tm">17:07:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> night
<a name="l-701"></a><span class="tm">17:07:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> nights
<a name="l-702"></a><span class="tm">17:07:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> BB fanfan
<a name="l-703"></a><span class="tm">17:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> yes
<a name="l-704"></a><span class="tm">17:08:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanfan&gt;</span> ^^
<a name="l-705"></a><span class="tm">17:08:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> could we perhaps push the CfP back a few days?  I'll have the software on conference.o.o this week, but i'd like to be around to fix any problems that come up after the opening
<a name="l-706"></a><span class="tm">17:08:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we need the venue confirmed so we can confirm the dates
<a name="l-707"></a><span class="tm">17:08:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I don't want to announce oSC13 without that secured
<a name="l-708"></a><span class="tm">17:09:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">znggo:</span> CfP announcement can move back by a week, we had said that the 13th was the absolute drop dead date
<a name="l-709"></a><span class="tm">17:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> secured means signed contract
<a name="l-710"></a><span class="tm">17:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span>  if we get the ok From SUSE for the money then we will have the venue secured, even without money for some time
<a name="l-711"></a><span class="tm">17:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but you are correct
<a name="l-712"></a><span class="tm">17:09:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> signed contract
<a name="l-713"></a><span class="tm">17:09:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> that's what i remembered, but talking about opening it on the 30th confused me :-)
<a name="l-714"></a><span class="tm">17:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not realistic in such a short term
<a name="l-715"></a><span class="tm">17:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what is realistic?
<a name="l-716"></a><span class="tm">17:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it depends on SUSE now
<a name="l-717"></a><span class="tm">17:10:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> cannot happen, too little time
<a name="l-718"></a><span class="tm">17:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you mean Agostin right?
<a name="l-719"></a><span class="tm">17:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-720"></a><span class="tm">17:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-721"></a><span class="tm">17:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I guess
<a name="l-722"></a><span class="tm">17:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">znggo:</span> we'd like to go earlier, but if the system is not quite ready we'll have to wait
<a name="l-723"></a><span class="tm">17:10:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you guess? With whom did you talk here? :)
<a name="l-724"></a><span class="tm">17:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> The olympic museum will be more than happy to close the dates :D
<a name="l-725"></a><span class="tm">17:11:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> with whom did you talk here at SUSE?
<a name="l-726"></a><span class="tm">17:11:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap I mean Augustin but I am sure he has someone above him
<a name="l-727"></a><span class="tm">17:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I think Agustin does not make all the decisions by himself. We have already contacted vuntz &amp; Agustin and Agustin already replied that he will have answers mid next week
<a name="l-728"></a><span class="tm">17:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-729"></a><span class="tm">17:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> answers to what?
<a name="l-730"></a><span class="tm">17:11:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> I made a list of quite a few questions I had, money related mostly
<a name="l-731"></a><span class="tm">17:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> venue payment is one of them
<a name="l-732"></a><span class="tm">17:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and for the venue
<a name="l-733"></a><span class="tm">17:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay then we need to speed up the venue stuff to be able to announce something
<a name="l-734"></a><span class="tm">17:12:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> So lets have everything ready for next week, announcement, logo etc. and then just "push the release button" when the contract is signed
<a name="l-735"></a><span class="tm">17:12:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> does that work for everyone?
<a name="l-736"></a><span class="tm">17:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;znggo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> the software is ready, and i'll have it running on the server this week for testing, but i'm not going to have a computer at hand between the 21st and 29th, so a few days more to fix problems that were found would be nice
<a name="l-737"></a><span class="tm">17:13:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the museum told us that if we come to a general agreement they can book the dates and then wait for the contracts and stuff
<a name="l-738"></a><span class="tm">17:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">znggo:</span> sounds good
<a name="l-739"></a><span class="tm">17:13:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> yes what warlordfff said
<a name="l-740"></a><span class="tm">17:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> how do we come to a general agreement?
<a name="l-741"></a><span class="tm">17:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> and for what it's worth we find the people in charge of the venue very professional and we have an understanding
<a name="l-742"></a><span class="tm">17:13:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have the Municallity of Thessaloniki that Support us so we have some 'Power" to that
<a name="l-743"></a><span class="tm">17:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> orally that is
<a name="l-744"></a><span class="tm">17:14:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> between?
<a name="l-745"></a><span class="tm">17:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Agostin and the Venue people?
<a name="l-746"></a><span class="tm">17:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> me/kostas &amp; director of venue&amp;person in charge for bookings in venue
<a name="l-747"></a><span class="tm">17:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay cool
<a name="l-748"></a><span class="tm">17:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Agustin was on vacation until very recently
<a name="l-749"></a><span class="tm">17:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> so he only replied to my email on Friday telling me to make a list of all questions
<a name="l-750"></a><span class="tm">17:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Sounds to me like we already have a "handshake agreement" on the local side, we just need SUSE to agree
<a name="l-751"></a><span class="tm">17:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> which I did and sent to him (and vincent) today
<a name="l-752"></a><span class="tm">17:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  exactly
<a name="l-753"></a><span class="tm">17:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then we only need to get Agostin to confirm 7K and we're good
<a name="l-754"></a><span class="tm">17:15:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Yep
<a name="l-755"></a><span class="tm">17:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-756"></a><span class="tm">17:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> alright
<a name="l-757"></a><span class="tm">17:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> but one week for written contract is too short as far as I am concerned
<a name="l-758"></a><span class="tm">17:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I see what I can do
<a name="l-759"></a><span class="tm">17:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> just for the record, price is 6500 euro + 23% VAT (if vat will be charged is to be discussed, I will update you asap)
<a name="l-760"></a><span class="tm">17:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> alright
<a name="l-761"></a><span class="tm">17:16:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then let's try to make everything ready for Tuesday 12:00
<a name="l-762"></a><span class="tm">17:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> to announce on Wednesday
<a name="l-763"></a><span class="tm">17:16:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> differentreality -- I can agree we had to start our contract in October for our June linux fest
<a name="l-764"></a><span class="tm">17:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> sounds like we're all done here for today?
<a name="l-765"></a><span class="tm">17:17:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> Agustin said that Tuesday-Wednesday (next week) he will have the answers to everything
<a name="l-766"></a><span class="tm">17:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;differentreality&gt;</span> on our side (local) I will be in touch by phone with the venue again within that time
<a name="l-767"></a><span class="tm">17:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I hope so, painkillers sterted to work on me and I am not 100% operational anymore
<a name="l-768"></a><span class="tm">17:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">differentreality:</span> okay
