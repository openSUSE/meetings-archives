<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:45:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> you might want to contact one of the University admin office and get a hold of someone that handles job postings
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:46:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> will to pay about $100 to get he flyers distributed.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:46:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> If there is no other choice I can try to get down there to distribute
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:46:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> should be a nice quick job for someone with a car
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">stevedorries:</span> that works for me, you can earn the $100 bucks as far as I am concerned
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> ok. I' was thinking about reaching out the CS dept and asking them to send some emails to the student but I can do what you asked also
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> we need to cast the net as far as possible, we have no time for multiple go arounds and probing different channels
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> Yes, they will certainly do that. I already have the CS department at Daytona State College doing that for their classes
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:47:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> registration stands at 36 only :(
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:48:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I'd like to see at least 100 registered
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:48:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> Randal Schwartz gave our first plug on FLOSS-Weekly yesterday
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:49:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> ok so, I'll contact their admin offices and get a hold of someone that handles job postings to post the flyers for us
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:49:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> so what's the deal on the flyer distribution than, stevedorries or do we wait a week to see if we pay someone local to Orlando?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:49:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> and once I get a contact info shall I send that list to stevedorries ?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> That would depend on if we're hiring someone in Orlando or if I'm driving there
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:50:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> yup, I guess the verdict is to wait a week
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:51:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> So if we do not have anyone willing to take our money to distribute flyers than stevedorries will do the deed and get paid for it
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> work for everyone?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:51:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span>  once I get a contact info shall I send that list to stevedorries ?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:51:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agree</span><span class="cmdline"></span>
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:52:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> I would say to send it to me in either case
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:53:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> That way there is someone in state if someone needs to contact us about it
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> resend the e-mail you sent to the list to stevedorries, apparently a mailserver ate his copy
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:53:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I've sent that already. ;)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> Just came in too
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:53:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">stevedorries:</span> I'll send you the contact info by next Tuesday (and CC robjo as well)
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:53:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> great, than I have no idea whatother list you are talking about
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:54:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> Looks like a pretty thorough list too
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:54:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK anything else on local outreach?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:54:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> list with people who can handles job postings to post the flyers for us

<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:54:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:56:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> Has it been decided who is going to be on FLOSS-Weekly yet?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:56:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> just don't enter a wait loop, when you have someone on the phone or e-mail will to post make certain they do it

<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">16:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@robjo:</span> quick question.

<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">16:10:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> if we have both stevedorries and jospoortvliet speaking we will at some point end up with 3 "competeing" sessions
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">16:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I have shot in talk proposals, in case you would lke me to talk...
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am OK with that, other people's input is welcome....
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">16:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> true. Question then is about subjects - are the sessions things which compete for audiences or not
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> https://conference.opensuse.org/osem/conference/summit13/schedule
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> can everyone just take a quick look at give some feedback
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">16:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> My idea was a talk about OSS use in Scouting and other youth oriented programs
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">16:12:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> as you can see, on Saturday "Tigger" is currently empty
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">16:12:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> say the scalable web apps session and the kiwi - both are very technical. Easily room for a session about promoting openSUSE at conferences or building local communities
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">16:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> like I shot in :D
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">16:12:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> I don't think that competes with anything on the schedule
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">16:13:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">16:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> welll
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">16:13:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> perhaps with the 15 years of open source
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">16:13:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but the mirrorbrain, web apps and virtualization talks are technical and  social/marketing sessions would not really interfere
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">16:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> How do you figure?
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">16:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">stevedorries:</span> it is about people, social stuff, low barrier- not technical. Just like the talks about marketing or building communities.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">16:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> ahhh
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">16:14:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;stevedorries&gt;</span> point
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">16:14:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> I would suggest that between 16:30 and 17:30 there is room in the schedule for social subjects
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">16:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> on the 16th
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">16:15:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> my concern is a bit less about competing topics, rather about competition for people in general, currently on 36 people registered
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">16:15:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> same with 17:00 to 17:30 on the 15th
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">16:15:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> Robert does quite some Keynotes :)
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">16:15:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> well, it is pointless for them to sit in a super technical talk if they have no idea what it is about
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">16:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> better provide them something that at least makes sense
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">16:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> yeah, he's all over :D
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">16:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> how are you?
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">16:16:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> very good.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">16:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> good :D
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> both is very good
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">16:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I see you have fun preparing the summit
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">16:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Well, I  and vuntz are doing the opening keynote together
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">16:17:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the second keynot my name is just a placeholder
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">16:17:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> haha
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">16:18:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK then now that we have drifted a bit, what's the verdict, 3 sessions in parallel, yes or no?
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">16:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I say it is fine
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">16:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> despite the nr of registrations
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">16:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it's good to offer ppl something not too technical at least at most times
