<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">17:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> budget discussions are still on going, loks like we have the necessary money to get the keynote speaker :)
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">17:17:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Just need to figure out if we can do all the booking flight &amp; hotel ahead of time or if we need to go the reimbursement route
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">17:17:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> I'm waiting for the artwork to start my second task -  find Orlando local LUGs, Universities/Colleges and contact about Summit
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">17:18:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> Please do not wait, we know LUGs want a long lead time, thus send out the initial contact e-mail as son as your time allows please
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">17:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> my other task - ticket price suggestion and making available in SUSE Web shop is complete… I think that one is done.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">17:18:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> ok @robjo
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">17:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> We have tickets in the SUSE shop already? Great
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">17:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Did you send me the link?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">17:18:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> yep… you didn't see my emails?
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">17:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> I sent out to the ML
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">17:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I am still way behind on e-mail reading, sorry
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">17:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> Stella will make them available in OSEM
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">17:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> OK, I'll update summit.o.o, hopefully today
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">17:20:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> check it out
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">17:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> https://buy.suse.com/store/suse/en_US/buy/productID.264935300
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">17:20:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> hopefully we can also get the ticket links into the summit article
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">17:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> unfortunately I had to remove the mickey mouse head logo because of copyright issues but Andy gave a nice oSSUM13 logo so, we are good. Check that out robjo
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">17:22:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I think that's really it for today, CfP is still open for another week then we'll have to race to get the program together
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">17:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Local out reach, budget, meal planning, and TSP are the items we need to focus on
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">17:23:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Cool.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">17:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmelo:</span> thanks for showing up and for the help
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">17:24:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> anytime @robjo. I'm glad I was able to help. Now, I'll focus on my second task then. ;)
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">17:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Lets have weekly meetings from now on until the event to make certain things stay somewhat on track and hopefully more people will start showing up.
