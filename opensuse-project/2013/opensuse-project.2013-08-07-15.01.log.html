<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:02:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, Funkypenguin: here?
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:02:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> robjo said on the list he wouldn't be able to join
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> and who else is here? :-)
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I'm here
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:05:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I'm doing a horrible nasty upgrade of a terrible ugly windows based .NET application that I'd rather put out of its misery than touch
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:05:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> but i'm here..
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:05:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:05:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> anybody else?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> if it's just Ilmehtar and me, then we might as well just watch Ilmehtar's upgrade fail :-)
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:06:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;DimStar&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;DimStar&gt;</span> live stream?
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:06:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> we can review and clear one Action Item - I finally updated -project on the Local Coodinator programme, we're having a meeting next Tuesday
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:06:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">DimStar:</span> banned on YouTube - too much swearing
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> yay!
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:08:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> we have an item on the agenda (openSUSE on raspberry pi)
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:08:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> but I'm not sure there's anyone to discuss this item?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:08:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I was the one to put it on the agenda
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:08:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> it sucks to use raspbian instead of opensuse
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:09:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> hey madanyang
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so let's discuss this
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">openSUSE on raspberry pi</span>
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> want to give a quick intro on the topic?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;andy0023&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info</span><span class="cmdline"></span>
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:10:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> well the whole situation is on the mailing-list of the opensuse-arm
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> it starts with http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2013-07/msg00050.html
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> can you summerise it?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> the key is http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2013-08/msg00000.html
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:11:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> andrew wafaa says the priority is armv7 since it is future
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:12:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> but the real truth of the matter is raspi is cheap and has 1.5 millon sold out
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:12:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> with no opensuse running on it
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:12:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> ok maybe exagration but not many
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> if raspi is aiming youngsters and those who want to stay young we as opensuse are not taking part
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:13:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> so this is a nutshell summary
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:15:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I quickly read the thread, and it seems to me that the issue is simply that nobody is working on armv6
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> vuntz the obs has no running armv6
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> see https://build.opensuse.org/monitor
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:16:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> I see no reply to http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2013-08/msg00008.html
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> but if there is no running armv6 it is somehow related to obs and probably only adrian can answer
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:20:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> but in http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2013-07/msg00050.html there was "all packages build in OBS are for ARM6"
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:21:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so it sounds like we can build packages from armv6
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> I see both an armv6 and armv5 scheduler and stats that suggest packages are getting built. if I recall correctly, it's possible to build armv6 packages on OBS using the QEMU method, pretty sure I remember Adrian talking about that at some point
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:22:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> OBS might not have armv6 hardware, that would explain why you dont see it in the list of builders
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> shouldn't qemu instances be visible also
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:23:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> but my understanding is a proper 'port' of openSUSE to a new architecture requires a lot more than just 'can obs build it'? I know the ARM team have to put a lot of love and attention into getting hardware/drivers/etc all working - and from Andy's mail I think that's the biggest roadblock - it's lots of work, and they want to focus on newer
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:23:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> architectures
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:23:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> - http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm/2013-07/msg00050.html "all packages build in OBS are for ARM6, but can't be used, as I have no image
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:23:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> to start from."
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> that doesn't sound like an OBS limitation
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> so fine to loose a potential market with affordable hardware sorry that is bad business
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> it sounds to me that we simply need someone to build such an image :/
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> and this is an area where we can only rely on what people want to do
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> I'll have a look to build a jeos-jeos image (double jeos is intended)
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> great :)

<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:27:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> I will blog it through lizards, but I have 2 weeks before holidays so I am a bit tight

<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> how about donating some raspis ?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">it seems the only missing piece is somebody working on a base image</span>
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> this could work, but we still need to find somebody who would be willing to do the work
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:28:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> I would suggest the idea on the arm mailing list
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:29:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> and if people say "I'm happy to step up if I get the hardware", then donation would be useful
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:29:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> OMG one more to join/follow/read/post
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:30:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> in the mean time is there any reason that arm mailing list is not in news.gmane.org
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:31:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I think it's simply because someone needs to register it in gmane.org
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I believe anyone can do that
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:31:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> (although I never did it myself, so not sure how to do it :-))
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:31:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> a quick google suggests - http://gmane.org/add.php
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:33:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> any other topic?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:33:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> Yes but isn't there a team/person to these simple things
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> I am not expecting suse people to do it but isn't an opensuse team not there like forums
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:35:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> hmm? there's dozens of services like gmane, heck, we even have our own with lists.opensuse.org, I dont think it would be a productive use of someones time to go around making sure we're registered on every single one of them
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> especially as anyone who does want it, can request it themselves .. if you want to make sure all the opensuse mailing lists are on gmane, please go ahead :)
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> Ok will do
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:37:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> thank you
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> no other topic?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> sorry im here now
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:39:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Funkypenguin:</span> heh, want to comment on the chat above?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> just catching up on the backlog
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:41:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> registration done
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> ok...
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:41:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> re the RaspberryPi topic:
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:41:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> there is work already underway to support it
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:42:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> we used to have ARMv5 which was able to run on the Pi, but as the Pi is the only device people were concerned about we shelved v5 in favour for the better optimised v6
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> problem as I mentioned in the thread is that we are very constrained with resources (read people)
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> as far as the core distro is concerned, v7 and above are the target architectures - the Pi is the only v6 board available and there are many more v7 devices
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:44:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> (and prices are dropping constantly)
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:45:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> if people want Pi support they will unfortunately have to step up and help out, we just cant do it all - the few people we have are struggling as it is
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:46:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> having Pi hardware won't really help much as it doesn't support KVM/Xen and as such can't be used in the OBS, only qemu
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> it is mostly people helping fix the base image and also fix package breakages
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:46:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Funkypenguin:</span> but donating the hardware to some people might motivate them?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:47:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> ah, donating hardware to people wanting to help could indeed be beneficial
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:47:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> my concern is making sure that those people actually do the work
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:47:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> im all for it in theory
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:47:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:48:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Funkypenguin:</span> which devel repo to be branched to fix problems
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:49:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory:ARM is the correct repo to use
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:49:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> but as vuntz mentioned we need to get the bootstrap complete
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> the best thing to do is to ask either on irc or mailing list for how best to help out with that
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:52:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> one thing to note is that you may need to wait for a response
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:53:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> does anyone else have any comments on this topic?
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:53:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> don't get me wrong im not saying we shouldn't support the Pi, just that it isn't a focus for us
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:54:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Funkypenguin:</span> on the openSUSE:Factory:Arm when I look there is standard/armv6l and then there is armv6l
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:54:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> it is effectively the same issue that many other projects have of concentrating on current and future architectures rather than old one
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:56:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">madanyang:</span> use armv6hl
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:56:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Funkypenguin:</span> and until the armv6l has the backlog cleared there is not much to do, or ?
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:56:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> pretty much
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:57:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Funkypenguin&gt;</span> unfortunately we're running out of dylithium crytals for the OBS, so if we can find some more it's a waiting game
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:57:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> as we're nearing the end of the hour: is there any other quick topic people would like to discuss?
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:57:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> otherwise, we're done and arm discussion can go on :-)
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:58:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;madanyang&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> Thanks
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:58:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> nothing, so we're done :-)
