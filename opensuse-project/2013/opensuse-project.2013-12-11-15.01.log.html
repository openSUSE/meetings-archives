<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:04:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> iirc, we had completed all the action items, so nothing to review
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:04:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> and we have two topics on the agenda:
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:04:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> Q&amp;A about openSUSE 2016
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:04:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> oSC15 ideas about finding a location

<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:04:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> right, there was nothing left
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so let's move straight to the big topic

<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so should we just have questions, or is there anyone who wants to do a quick intro?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> (for those who might have missed the topic set- The current topic is "Q&amp;A about openSUSE 2016")
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> I would like to do a short intro

<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:09:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> sure

<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:10:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> quite an audience today
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> first apologize for the selected approach of sending separate mails apparently unconnected in some way. Probably doing something like this: http://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/11/discussing-about-the-future-of-opensuse/
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> from the very beginning would have helped
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> there was more of a warmup act than usual
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> a lot
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:11:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> second. we are processing the feedback and we will try to summarize it and send some modified proposals when we have them
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> there is one article missing that contains some info about the effort and time we propose to put on this
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:12:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> that's all
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> done
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> thanks vuntz
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:14:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> a rough estimate for the delay ? between one day, one week, one month ?
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> yes, but please read it in the article ;-)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> it will be there
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> together with other info
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> Aka before we publish the next thing and before we publish new mails with feedback incorporated?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> s/and/or/
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:16:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> I guess tigerfoot is asking about the delay for publishing that article
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:16:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> I know ;-)
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:17:32 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">see only "in three years" date/delay related things in the lizard article :-)</span>
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Can I ask something?
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> the 2016 vision is rather limited
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> I would love to send everything this week
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:18:11 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">can accept, when its done, that's just a debian way of doing things :-)</span>
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> sure
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> don't ask to ask...
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I see 7 proposals
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:18:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> you're talking about 13.2 release delay?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> While the openSUSE team asks for time to process our feedback, we are expected to give a knee jerk response, kind of unfair
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> no no just about the feedback and future action plans summary promised mail...
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I am not pointing fingers
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:19:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> but I am saying we also need some time
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> atleast me
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> I am working on the assumption that we will be talking the following weeks about all this
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> at least
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:20:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> there are few things I loved.. few things I did not like
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:20:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> obviously we want to go back to execution as soon as possible, but some things needs time to be discussed and we want to have that time
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> so we need also to provide it
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:21:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I would just like to express my..discomfort, at the feeling that all of these proposals (some of which appear to be more interconnected than others) have all been pre-planned out and are being released at some predetermined schedule.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> The approach feels 'alien' to me, I'm much more used to seeing new ideas be presented at that initial 'idea' stage, and then iterated, each step including feedback. This whole 'data dump' on the community, with a relatively brief window for feedback, followed by your 'analysis' and another future 'data dump' where you report on your findings seems
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> very..'weird' to me
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> my .2c: of the smaller proposals, 1-7, most are fine, common sense approaches to improving our infrastructure and process
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:22:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> Maybe artificial is a better word. And I see huge potential for mistakes to be made, incorrect conclusions to be made, will the community be given any opportunity to provide corrections if your analysis is wrong? ultimately I feel this whole approach doesn't seem very open for community engagement.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:23:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ilmehtar:</span> +1
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:23:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> however the 2016 vision is limited, unspecific and full of 'apple pie' items that we don't need 2 years to do.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:23:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> better to leave it out if you have no vision
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:24:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> err, i'm in my civvies aren't I?
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> can you write a mail about it? Maybe we can provide some answers to your points that clarifies something
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Apparently we have reached a point where only 1 thing can be done at a time, either discuss stuff, i.e. "data dump" or "execute", i.e. don't communicate and just work
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:25:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> fits in the "black or white" operating mode of some people, I guess
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> that is your perception and we do not share it
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> what's your immediate response to this criticism?  i just don't see a need for a long range plan to have circular homilies like "attract new players by being attractive to new players"
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> Hi all ...
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:25:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> Sorry for dropping late :P
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:25:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> perception is reality!
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> and there is plenty of empirical evidence that supports my perception
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:26:42 </span><span class="nka">* |miska|</span> <span class="ac">agrees that 2016 title was unfortunate and missleading</span>
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> My response would be: is the plan the root that leads to the proposed actions. Without the long term plan, we probably would have presented a different approach.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:26:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> But anyway, it's just title :-)
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:27:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> I am sorry I got disconnected
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:28:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> you could have written the whole mail as as "more of teh same, but better (sic)"
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:28:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> SO there is a plan that is being dolled out in predetermined spoon sized portions that someone decided were good chunks for the community to swallow
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:28:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> for some, many of the exposed information is not new. But we cannot work on the assumption that everybody is in the same position.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:29:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> not a very nice way to present ideas to others
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:29:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> no, there is a proposal of a plan that we are discussing that I think it can derive in linked and doable actions that can put us in a better position than we are right now
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:30:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> my concern is sometimes the misused "us" words.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:31:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> us=project in this sentence
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:31:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> sometimes it is community in a whole, sometimes more related to "our" openSUSE Team
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> i don't think robjo is questioning that. i think his (and Ilmehtar's) problem is with the method of doing closed source proposal development and then tossing it over the wall
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Who here believes that the proposals presented are part of a "mostly preconceived plan"?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> +1
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> me
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:31:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> me
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:32:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> &lt;recuses himself/&gt;
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:32:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> there are many people who disagrees with the followed method
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> ... including me
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:32:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> but they are proposing to use a method that already failed in the past
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:32:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> my main problem is with the content produced by this method
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:33:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> put briefly: i don't think the hooch you're brewing is strong enough to work.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:33:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> that is a different problem
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:33:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> there are risks, I know, but there are also a strong determination and a solid group behind the proposal.
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:34:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> you mean we should change the method, cause it fail once, to a new way of failing ...
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:34:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> Okay, lets flip it on it's head for a second. How pleased would you be if a Team in the openSUSE community came to you with a dramatic proposal which, if accepted, would impact the way you and your team work, why you and your team work, and the goals you and your team work towards.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:34:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> but that doesn't change the result.
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:34:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> It's clear from the way they present the plan, they've worked on it for months, and they're revealing it in a series of big chunky documents that need a lot of reading
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I imagine, your initial reaction would be something along the line of "Who the heck are these people telling me how I should be doing things? Why have they kept all this secret until now? What else are they hiding? Are they actually going to listen to my feedback?"
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> The fact the proposals might include good stuff or not is immaterial, the process is rotten to the 'usual' way of doing business in an open project. And this is how I find myself feeling as I see these '2016 proposals' coming to light.

<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> problem is that the way things get presented has a big impact on how things are received and where there is too much noise in the presentation it is extremely difficult to find the signal

<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:44:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> I really love the factory proposal, even though I do not understand a lot of it (specially the openqa one)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:44:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> remember it's 16:43 in most of the openSUSE world ;)

<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:45:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> yes.. there are a few proposals I think like the Karma one

<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:45:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> achieving that goal by iteration is something that would take us too long. We need to apply an intensive action to the process, to change it
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:46:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> feel free to ask concrete questions, then :-)
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:46:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> Why are we under time pressure?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">15:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> there is a christmas party in NBG today ;)
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">15:47:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> then ok.. I will ask I will take the Karma one.. initially I liked it a lot. but then the excel sheet cropped up and I saw thtat it is more scarier than it seemed to be
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">15:47:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> why aren't we invited there then ??? :-)
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> thanks for sharing, I guess we should have started iterating in January then
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:47:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;antlarr&gt;</span> hi, I just arrived. I'll try to read the comments quickly
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:47:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> if you want to repeat this session in the future, just tell us, so instead of having one person of the team on them, as usual, we can be more, depending on the topic.
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:47:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> I disagree. Had you started iteration at the same time you started your planning, we'd probably already have results done by now. I also don't agree that any one individual/Team in the Project should have the right to arbitrarily take 'intensive action'
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">15:48:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> I hate the spreadsheet as well
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">15:48:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> if you look at the sheet henne created 100 events in an year ( comeone who can do it ), prompt reviews (too difficult) on wiki, some of us work on weekends only
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">15:48:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> and that's the crux of my problems with the proposal: i don't see an intensive action in the plans. the factory and open governance suggestions are worthwhile refinements of existing processes, karma is window dressing, OSEP nice to have, but nothing intensive is there
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">15:48:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> actually we have a pretty good idea on the work required for openqa, but we have not a good one for the whole staging thing
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">15:48:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> there's more depressive fact 157 votes / 547 members ...

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">15:48:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> That's why I proposed different approach on mailing list
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">15:48:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> but I'm certain what we do right now is madness
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">15:48:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">15:48:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> that is guessing

<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:49:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> so IMO we should look those numbers in the eye and accept we are a tiny community, and start acting like a tiny startup team with lots of energy (and chaos) not more rounds of proposals and planning.
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:49:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">|miska|:</span> yes I saw that.. thanks.. what I would suggest is really try to subtly disrupt.. make sure that people feel that they are welcome at high standards which are achievable

<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">15:51:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> yes and that is why I agreed to it, if you look at my mail, I think people misunderstood again for the whole process

We talk about being open, sharing the work and creating community. But many of the current processes goes in the opposite direction.

<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">16:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> A few thoughts on 1) a) I believe your current processes, the way these 2016 have been put together, are the worst example of processes going in the opposite direction. Closed, opaque. I agree we should move towards openness, I don't see how long planning windows and weighty proposal documents fit into that goal.
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">16:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> b) you may have common agreement inside your team, but your team is just a small fraction of the ~200-300 contributors we have. I think the reaction to the 2016 proposals shows that we have some way to go before there is that common agreement. I think focusing on practical proposals (like Coolo's Factory posts) is the best way to achieve that.

<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">16:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> exactly my point Ilmehtar
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">16:29:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> we don't, we need only to select who do we want to reach
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">16:29:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> we cannot be everybody's everything in a linux distro
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">16:29:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> well said
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">16:30:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> why do we need to choose?
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">16:30:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> well if we can get more software developers, users of their products will naturally adopt whatever platform the developers prefer
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">16:30:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> and make sure we are the first or second choice for those selected
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">16:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> that is how Ubuntu managed to get so much mind share
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">16:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> we shouldn't aim for second - *ever*

It seems to me you're quite set on the idea of 2 versions
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">16:32:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> the proposal is clear about this point yes. We clearly propose to split the distribution in two parts
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">16:32:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> I would say split
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">16:32:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ishwon&gt;</span> I don't find the comparison with Ubuntu a nice thing. Wherever I do openSUSE presentation people like it, like the features &amp; facilities. I even have people moving from Ubuntu to openSUSE.
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">16:32:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> a development version based on an enhaced factory and a user centric version
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">16:32:36 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">is looking around to find his left part, just splitted</span>
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">16:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Let existing focus of Factory and Release diverge a little further
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">16:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> but what is the difference from factory and "user" versions?
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">16:33:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> can we finish at 17:45
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">16:33:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> we need to go.

<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">16:34:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> I don't recall anyone outlining a rough frame work of pros and cons for a split
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">16:34:09 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">think no way :-) the meeting end has been delayed until 19h45</span>
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">16:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> <span class="hi">awafaa:</span> This question is something we will talk far and long for lol :)

<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">16:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> Can toscalix_ explain the ins and outs of this split in the ML?
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">16:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">awafaa:</span> Factory is development version - less qa and stability and more bleeding edge and cool, release - stable and tested for people who don't want cool new things everyday and want just to "work"
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">16:35:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> sure, we can end in 10 minutes

<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">16:36:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> we have the Xmas party, that's all
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">16:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> I feel a few of us here want to here more detail specifically about your idea to split development for the distribution
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">16:36:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> hear*
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">16:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> go and be merry, that doesn't mean the meeting has to end
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">16:36:40 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">waves goods, foods, beers to all Xmas P</span>
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">16:36:45 </span><span class="nka">* awafaa</span> <span class="ac">actually thinks there is more likely to be a preference for developers to use rolling releases and as such their users will want to do the same, almost negating the product</span>
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">16:37:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> we can come again if you guys want

<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">16:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> yup, i have the same recollection
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">16:37:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> <span class="hi">awafaa:</span> I agree. They will have to define this one to understand more

<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">16:38:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> we need to make sure this fit in the agenda. We have eaten most of the time
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">16:38:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> actually one would have thought that the openSUSE team would always be in -project seeing as what the do directly affects the openSUSE Project
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">16:38:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">coolo:</span> thanks "we" as in "we" the king, got it
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">16:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> my opinion - I love the proposed changes for Factory - I think we should do them. I don't understand/haven't seen the justification for a 'user centric' release. I think we should do the Factory changes now. The rest can still be discussed. And this is why I like iterative processes - making Factory better doesn't need Misc. Planning Point 452 to be fully
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">16:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> fleshed out.
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">16:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;awafaa&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> +1

<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">16:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> aie ... you mean otherwise people at SUSE doesn't have access to openSUSE project stuff ?
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">16:40:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> We are just mostly not visible, but we are always spying on you :-P
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">16:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> .... why dont you just encorage the other SUSE employees to read the minutes/report that we publish openly for the whole community?
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">16:41:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> that is probably because for us it is easier to understand what development changes mean. Now they will need to explore the changes needed for a "user centric" distro. Which is an area that we do not dive into as much. The need for is another thing that we need to explore. How are we closer to an everyday non-programmer? Food for thought
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">16:41:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> Ilmehtar, reason 1 for a "user-centric" release -&gt; "you want users", and I am unsure about how many we are attracting and how many we are keeping far due to the usual unresolved issues :-)
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">16:42:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Sleep_Walker&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> I'm not sure other SUSE employees have already read all the e-mails toscalix_ and openSUSE team is producing...
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">16:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> there is always a link in the minutes, but lazy people that reads our meeting minutes gets the project's ones for free
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">16:42:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;antlarr&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> that's exactly what is done, we put a link to the official logs
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">16:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Well, user centric distro is not on the plate right now
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">16:42:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> And we have enough flames with Factory now ;-)
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">16:42:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> we play our role as link everyday. But people is used to reading some newsletters and not others, so we try to at least put a openSUSE goody in all of them
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">16:42:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">|miska|:</span> is a stable developer centric distro on the plate :P one which we can say we wont change it for next 6 months
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">16:43:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Sleep_Walker:</span> I guarantee you that they haven't
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">16:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> even if we pay for it ;-)
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">16:43:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1_:</span> Factory changes everyday

<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">16:43:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> much better than we have done in the past
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">16:44:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;plinnell&gt;</span> yup

<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">16:44:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> Well, my point was, there is no point in duscising what we might do with stable release when we have plenty Factory ideas on our plate and world could end before we finish them
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">16:44:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;plinnell&gt;</span> <span class="hi">|miska|:</span> exactly
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">16:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">|miska|:</span> we agree
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">16:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;toscalix_&gt;</span> I have to leave. I enjoyed. Thanks.
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">16:45:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> just on the tone we use on factory thread ml, this doesn't mean we fixed all what we have to :-)
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">16:45:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">toscalix_:</span> thanks for your time
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">16:45:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;plinnell&gt;</span> this has been good
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">16:45:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> next topic? :-)
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">16:45:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> One thing that is being neglected in all of this is that the impact of implementing the changes has not been made public
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">16:46:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> tigerfoot, my answer was to your "grow/mature" statement. The tone changed because people changed (meaning they are other individuals)
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">16:46:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> thanks toscalix_ &amp; the whole team.
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> omg we agree :-)
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:46:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;plinnell&gt;</span> one thing we sometimes forget is not everyone is a native English speaker, so written communication sometime lacks nuances
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">16:46:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> the openSUSE team appears to operate as whole on an "either or" basis.
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">16:46:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">plinnell:</span> we know peter, it's okay, we forgive you
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:46:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> :P
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:46:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> well, we can go on a bit if people still want to discuss, but I suggest to conclude in the next 10 minutes (at least, for the official meeting part, discussion can go on afterwards)
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:46:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;plinnell&gt;</span> lol :d
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">16:47:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> My main concern is that you talk too much about Factory, which is of no interest in terms of gaining share, and very very little about products and releases that a user might want to use.
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> thus if the whole openSUSE team works on fiddling with OBS and the new factory model it will have an effect on other work they have been doing that leads toward a release
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:48:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> as of know most of the world, that includes openSUSE contributors, is probably under the assumption that 13.2 is due in July or so next year (8 month cycle)
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:48:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vuntz:</span> so we drop the other questons to next meeting. Sounds good for me.
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:48:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> considering the current mode of operation there is a lot of work that will need to be picked up by others to get there
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:48:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> Factory is nice and all, but from my perspective there is way too much focus on the process, and very little on fixing "practical problems" that keep users away (see very stupid technical issues that have been affecting us forever)
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> yeah, there was only one other topic and we postpone it
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> thus there is an effect that is currently be ignored/swept under the rug
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:49:40 </span><span class="nka">* AlbertoP</span> <span class="ac">goes back in silent mode :)</span>
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">16:49:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> you figure that "factory" is our development process?
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:49:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> where is 'user-centric distro' actually proposed?
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:50:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> The tricky part is, that that one "practical problem" that keep users away is different for every user :-)
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> you can't fix technical problems without working on the process too
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">16:50:14 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">look in /dev/null and found an awnser for wstephenson</span>
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">16:50:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> yes, the openSUSE team would like to concentrate efforts in improving factory (after reaching agreements on how to do it), and that means that we will appreciate people stepping into the release process
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">16:50:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> And most people "in" are not affected otherwise they would have fixed it already
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">16:51:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> coolo, my point is that the process is the only discussed aspect. There is no plan to address practical problems at the moment, at least not practical problems that have affected users for a long time. Then well, I certainly do not have the view of someone working at suse :)

<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">16:52:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> so why is that so hard to put in a mail message, and skip all the fluff and political BS
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">16:52:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> thanks - i had read that but not seen that as a call for a "user centred release" a la ubuntu/mint/blue thingy linux
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">16:52:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ancorgs:</span> I know that's not your idea
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">16:52:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> tigerfoot, ok. Fine. Thanks for clarifying. Then it benefit suse only, not the community of its users though.
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">16:53:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> nope, from my point of view, if I'm, able as contributor to return to factory daily usage, then
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">16:53:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> not saying it's bad, but it will have probably an effect on delaying the perception of improvements...
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">16:53:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> I wont bother updating my relaese.. simple
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">16:53:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">robjo:</span> You mean differnet communication tones that are caused by different people writing the mails?
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">16:53:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> later end user's grandma will not have to fight with certain things, cause I will be able to fix more ...
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">16:53:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1_&gt;</span> I will start cherry picking stuff for myself
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">16:53:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> tigerfoot, that would make me a non-user if I have to use factory to have something decent though, for example.
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">16:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> depend of WE define what factory should be and how WE will handle its process and life.
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">16:55:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;|miska|&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> If we fix&amp;test stuff in Factory more, it will not end up in release
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">16:55:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> then we come back to some offers made by openSUSE Team and drawn by coolo.
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">16:55:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">|miska|:</span> no I mean express what you really want in a clear concise non offending way
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">16:55:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> tigerfoot, my point is opensuse desperately needs a *user perspective* of some sort, not a technical perspective, which it had forever (good or bad). All the talks about process led to make things more abstract and obscure in the past, and I don't see why it should be much different now. But then again, my 2 cents :)
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">16:55:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> so, guys
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">16:55:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> interrupting all of you a bit
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">16:55:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> I'll stop the meeting now, but feel free to go on afterwards
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">16:55:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> just one quick unrelated note
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">16:56:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ancorgs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> yes. that mail was supposed to provide "The Vision" with the split into a rolling but stabilized Factory ("enhaced factory") and a user centric release ("Overhauled openSUSE Release") with a surrounding "open governance model"
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">16:56:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vuntz&gt;</span> izabelvalverde wanted to remind everyone that members can vote for the elections until the 15th
