<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:42:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> No, I don't have any updates because I'm waiting for the flyer to be changed and because I'm working full time on the SUSECON/Summit appliances. My plan is to start reaching locals with the flyer/phone. Probably next week since I had some progress with the kiosk appliance last night
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robjo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> is on critical path ;)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmelo&gt;</span> I believe we still have enough time for that and that's why I'm focusing on the appliances
