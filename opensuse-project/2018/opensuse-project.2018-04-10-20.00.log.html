Users are important in open source development they can help to give feedback to developers. Any plan to increase the involvement of users from this part of the world? How all the candidates view this condition?</span>
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">20:04:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> go ahead aaron
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">20:04:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> Hi all
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">20:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> Yes, I have a plan......and is called openSUSE Academy
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">20:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> The openSUSE Academy project is the implementation of FOSS laboratories in each of the Universities that wish to participate in the use of openSUSE and lay the foundations for future developers of the openSUSE project.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">20:05:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Mir&gt;</span> (`-`)/ so like Linux Academy except a place where one can get SUSE and Opensuse training easier than currently?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">20:05:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tacit&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Mir:</span> sssh
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">20:06:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> These future developers will have local mentoring through some of the teachers who wish to contribute, as well as experts who are already developing the technologies within SUSE and openSUSE.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">20:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> In this way we will be promoting the use and development of the openSUSE project at a scale that no other FOSS project has carried out.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">20:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> END
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">20:06:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> ok. ana
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">20:07:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> Users are of course important, but what I would really like to achieve is more people from Asia and other parts of the world getting involved in openSUSE development.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">20:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> Sorry to be late
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">20:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> And as aluna I think mentoring is crucial here. I have for example written a blog post to encourage more students in Indonesia to apply to GSoC:
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">20:08:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> http://anamaria.martinezgomez.name/2018/02/15/gsoc-in-indonesia.html
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">20:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> And I have asked help to the community to translate it, so that versions of it have been published in Indonesian, Japanese and Spanish
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">20:10:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> Ana06, do you belong to any of the Facebook or Website for these groups?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">20:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> Regarding to the board, I think it can help to encourage and facilitate the collaboration between communities around the world
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">20:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> END
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">20:11:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> Ok. Thx ana. Gerry
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">20:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> My intent was to do all I can to find ways to try to attract Developers and other Contributors from ALL parts of the World.  Many Users, as well, since some Users become future Developers.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">20:11:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> END
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">20:11:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> Short and sweet. Gertjan
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">20:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> I think the board is well aware of the growing communities on the other continents, and has already done quite some things to support new communities, at the same time trying to keep them as close to the project as possible. This f.e. re. The Indonesian community, their domain, who to contact to get things done etc., the decision to send Board members to the openSUSE Asia conference on request of the organizers.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">20:14:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> I also think that the things mentioned by others should have the Board's support, but are things that can be initiated without the Board. A goal for the Project as a whole should always be to provide anything useful to make contributing easier, hence to attract more contributors
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">20:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> END
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">20:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> ok. thank you Gertjan. Simon
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">20:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> As someone who started out as a user outside Europe and Asia its something i've had a little experience with.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">20:15:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> I think attending conferences where they exist is a really good starting point, last year was the first time openSUSE/SUSE had a presence at linux.conf.au (Australia/NZ) and we had a huge number of people supprised that SUSE / openSUSE still existed and wasn't just a European thing.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">20:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> With that in mind expanding / encoraging more people to attend regional conferences to represent openSUSE through the travel support program would likely be a good starting point.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">20:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Mir&gt;</span> ^
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">20:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> One thing that openSUSE does better then many other distro's is local translations, I think we should continue to encourage users in all these areas to become "developers" in the sense of helping provide better translations, which will then see growth
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">20:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Mir&gt;</span> focusing on asia is good but one whould also encourage and support those in other regions to go to events and share their love and excitement for the project
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">20:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;terrorpup&gt;</span> I have to agree with Mir, it would be nice to see the US and North America grow more, right now the West Coast is the strongest.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">20:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Mir&gt;</span> australia too
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">20:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> in the end I think it really comes down to finding the already existing users in these areas and encouraging them to help push and grow the project to be bigger in there region. But one of the reasons I went to openSUSE asia summit last year was to help try and grow / support the users that exist in our area.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">20:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> END
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">20:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Mir:</span> there's not much time, please let's stick to a candidates debate.

<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">20:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek-Simon&gt;</span> I would say the question could have been equally worded to just outside Europe we could certainly grow more in the US
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">20:19:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> Thank you simon. So, there are questions coming in after responses. I would recommend them to be a sidebar conversation to keep the topics flowwing

<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">20:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">We're trying hard to reach out our communities, in Indonesia alone there are 4,225 members of openSUSE Indonesia facebook group. We use any means that we feel is easiest to communicate to the community. Currently we use Telegram group and it has around 300 users. IRC is good for developer communication, but new generation usually do not use it, they prefer instant messaging like telegram, whatsapp etc</span>
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">20:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> . How candidates see those messaging systems as a tool for communication?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">20:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ddemaio&gt;</span> aaron
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">20:21:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> for my telegram is the best option without any doubt, the security part that offers above whatsapp is a point in its favor
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">20:23:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> and even more so in these days where information is very committed worldwide

<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">20:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> I have to say that IRC is complicate even for developers when they first join. I still remember fighting with it when I started at openSUSE haha.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">20:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> I think it is really important to put the things easy to newcomers and for that it may be needed to use some more modern things, even if we don’t consider them to be perfect. Although IRC is strongly used in openSUSE, so we can not remove it, but we can provide alternatives.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">20:24:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> A twitter account for the board and a Telegram group for openSUSE could be helpful. It would really like to discuss with the community what alternatives they would find more useful and would like to join, as a an empty Telegram group doesn’t make much sense ;)
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">20:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robin_listas&gt;</span> There is a risk of spreading thin with too many channels
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">20:24:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ana06&gt;</span> The board seems a good place to start this discussion :)

<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">20:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> That is a tough question.  I see platforms such as Facebook as being Anti-Social Media and disseminators of Very Dangerous Disinformation, as well as Threats to Privacy.  However, it is a necessary thing for a Strong openSUSE presence to be on those platforms.  We need to make constructive use of all Communication channels.

<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">20:26:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> Being the admin for a couple of openSUSE pages, here's my 2 cents: These platforms are great for communication IMO, not for support. Generally speaking everything disappears in an endless, badly searchable stream. This contrary to f.e. forums, wiki, mailing list archives etc.
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">20:28:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knurpht&gt;</span> The nature of our communication IMO is completely different from private conversations. In "my openSUSE" world, I'd rather see everything as open as open can be.

<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">20:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;foursixnine&gt;</span> One cent: There are means to connect IRC channels to Telegram for example. But those options could be explored later I guess

<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">20:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek&gt;</span> I think facebook despite its privacy issues is a good tool, because heaps of people are already there, I don't think messaging apps such as whatsapp scale really well to big group chat they are good for organising meetings etc.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">20:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek&gt;</span> For support there are other things we can do to make irc easier for example if you go to enlightenment.org you will find a "talk to us" button which links you into enlightenments support irc channel, you do need to make the people on irc aware that there maybe new people joining who don't necessarily know how irc works so you can't expect them to follow some of the more traditional rules etc
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">20:34:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek&gt;</span> In general I think we just need to do kinda whats been done with Discord and go where the people are, people don't want to join a new service just to be on a project they want to use the things they are already using.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">20:34:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Simotek&gt;</span> As for telegram its not big here so i've never used it so I can't comment on it.

<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">20:40:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I have not been on the openSUSE Board before, so I do not know what I can accomplish or what effect I can have as a Board Member.
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">20:40:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> This comes down to the Communication issue again.  As a long-time openSUSE User and as an openSUSE Member, I have only a vague, general idea of what the Board actually does, although I know the Board Members have and are doing important things for the Project.  I think this is the same understanding the majority of the openSUSE Community has about the Board.
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">20:41:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I will be trying to get the information out to all of the Community what it is the Board does, is doing, and is trying to accomplish, so that the Community can play an active and constructive part in openSUSE decisions and direction.  We need more Community Involvement.
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">20:41:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> But, to do so, I need to be elected to that Board, and I need to find out what can be done.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">20:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I do know, however, that being effective on a Board such as this depends primarily on three conditions:  It depends on who the other Board Members are, what motivates them, and on the ability to effectively Communicate ideas and reason to enough of the other Board Members to gain team support for something of importance.
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">20:41:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> A respected openSUSE Contributor, Per Jessen, had also asked what I thought I could accomplish as a Member of the Board that I could not already accomplish as just a Community member.
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">20:41:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> That is a very good point.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">20:42:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> here are some subtle -- but very important -- differences.
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">20:42:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> The title of Board Member would add a little more weight and credibility to what I say and what ideas I put forward.
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">20:42:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> More importantly, though, as a Community member, I have more freedom to think about some of these things, maybe dabble at them, and the freedom to lose interest for awhile and wander away to other things in life for a week or a month or two, or even longer.  I could easily step into the Recording Studio for two or three months and absorb myself there, maybe even after a month or so of first isolating myself into a creative

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">20:42:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> However, by accepting a candidacy to be elected to a two-year term as a Board Member, I am making a commitment to the openSUSE Project.  If elected to the Board, I would be Obligated to concentrate on improving the openSUSE Project for the next two years, giving up the freedom to just wander away.

<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">20:53:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aluna&gt;</span> We can express our ideas, but it is necessary to have a theoretical framework that allows us to take an adequate line in our mailing lists and as a result, moderate the way we conduct ourselves in these lists.

<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">20:54:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I see far too many mails in the lists that do not belong there and should not be there.  When I am following a topic, as soon as it reaches the stage where enough is enough, I usually just select all the remaining mails in that topic thread and hit shift-delete.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">20:54:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I do the same for any future mails from that topic, and I am probably not alone.

<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">20:54:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I think that is about as much as can be done for mailing list moderation.
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">20:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> How would you moderate it?  What would you do to moderate it?  Once the writer hits send, the mail is gone out to all recipients.  You cannot delete it from the recipients' mailbox, even if it is an unacceptable post.
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">20:55:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> I do not see how you could even ban someone from the mailing list, if such an action was warranted.
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">20:55:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Fraser_Bell&gt;</span> For example, I can have almost an unlimited number of e-mail addresses from, at the very least, 10 different domains, probably more.  It would be impossible to block them all.
