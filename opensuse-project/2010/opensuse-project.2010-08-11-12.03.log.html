<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">12:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so we can close this as this is not actionable?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">12:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> or as tracked else where - ok, will do.

<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">12:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Teams and individuals send various status reports around. Coolo sends one for the distribution, the OBS team publishes meeting minutes, the boosters their "What are the boosters up to" blogposts, the board has a public meeting and so on and so on. Are there any questions regarding those or do we need to discuss anything in detail?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">12:11:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nothing?
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">12:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> who cares about what you do?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">12:12:04 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">ducks</span>
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">12:12:43 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">knows henne can't leave his place to look him up and beat him with a stick until the meeting is over</span>
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">12:13:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> what are you up to? ;)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">12:13:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> trying to pick a fight but henne apparently doesn't care
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">12:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> you are funny. you should get your own TV show :P
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">12:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> maybe I should go away and annoy ppl in real life
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">12:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> ok THAT is mean....
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">12:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> henne isnt here. The meetign is usually bot driven
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">12:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so no questions to the status reports
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">12:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> next topic

<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">12:14:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as there are no questions on the wiki...
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">12:14:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> feel free to come up with any additional topic we need to discuss
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">12:14:55 </span><span class="nka">* FunkyPenguin</span> <span class="ac">would like to ask a question that is partially linked to the previous item</span>
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">12:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> or ask your general question now :)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">12:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> ok this is in no way an attack on anyone
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">12:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what channel is this tv show jospoortvliet is on?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">12:15:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> but it is a bit of a criticism, but hopefully constructive
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">12:16:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> is it possible for our thirsty thirteen to be a bit more public in what they're doing?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">12:16:32 </span><span class="nka">* wstephenson</span> <span class="ac">has an AI to blog about that</span>
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">12:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">12:16:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> thanks
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">12:17:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> how would that look alike ?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">12:17:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> in an ideal world?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">12:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> dragotin, ah in an ideal world we would have a daily soap opera, adn radio show with magazine adverts
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">12:18:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> in the real world, i think initially it would mostly be blog posts
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">12:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> but also emails to a wider list, not just -boosters
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">12:18:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> is biweekly, after every standup meeting, fine?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">12:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> and the boosters would be the band members and roadies in a community-manager fronted death metal band?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">12:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> ok Jos is dutch so more likely a techno outfit now.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">12:19:06 </span><span class="nka">* dragotin</span> <span class="ac">doubts jos is good at death metal</span>
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">12:19:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> dragotin, that sounds like as good a start as any
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">12:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> wstephenson, i was thinking more of a boyzone style boyband ;)
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">12:19:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is what we want to do and FAIL
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">12:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> I couldn't have said that better ;-(
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">12:19:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> how about this: every week one of the team writes a blog about what has happened over the last week(s) in his/her area and maybe a bit about what cool stuff others are doing
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">12:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that means each booster has to write a blog every frickin' three months
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">12:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> don't tell me that's too muh work or I have to kick you ;-)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">12:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> i think part of the issue is the nature of what the boosters are doing
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">12:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but is there something bloggable every week?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">12:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> it may not be flashy and full of bling, and as such doesnt appear to be interesting to all
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">12:20:49 </span><span class="nka">* wstephenson</span> <span class="ac">puts down the fuze he's assembling and tries to look innocent</span>
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">12:20:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I was thinking about that already, yes
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">12:20:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> if there isn't they aren't doing anything interesting or fun - and need to find a more fun and interesting job :D
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">12:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> guys, its not about WHAT to do but HOW to not fail doing it
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">12:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean we need to see more blogging, but not blog just for the sake of blogging.   There should be real meaning to the content.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">12:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> ok so you mean it is disipline which is hard?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">12:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> yes
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">12:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> ok here's a suggestion  - how about we have a post on WHAT is being tackled, possibly WHY, and if you want to touch on HOW go by the approach of "this is the intended approach"
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">12:22:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> my problem with that is that I don't think that "the boosters" should be considered so much as a kind of closed team
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">12:22:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> ok, I get that
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">12:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so the problem is doing the blogging
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">12:23:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> dragotin, that's exactly the issue - they are atm
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">12:23:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I'd rather prefer if the boosters were active in different parts of our community
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">12:23:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> the problem is not the having topics for blogs, right?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">12:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> no, of course not
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">12:23:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what if we installed live-feed webcams over the boosters' desks so we see what they're doing?  Then they don't have to write about it.  :-)
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">12:23:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">12:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> he but you'd have to look at their ugly faces to figure out what they do...
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">12:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but I see the issue that there is too little visible publically
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">12:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">12:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> seriously, you guys are doing cool stuff (I assume), you should have some enthousiasm about that - and spread it...
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">12:24:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> maybe have a breakdown sent to -project after the standup meetings
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">12:24:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> a blog doesn't have to be a book, it can be a ' dude I did this cool thing' or 'dude I have this cool idea' and it's fine...
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">12:25:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, since i can remember the fine SUSE folk regardles of how you wish to spell the geeko are exceptionally modest people
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">12:25:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> in general i also think that this is not really a problem of the boosters
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">12:25:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> so they're to modest huh...
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">12:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes we can blog about our standup meeting results
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">12:25:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes that would be interesting
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">12:25:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and we will again
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">12:26:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but what dragotin means is that we usually work inside another opensuse team
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">12:26:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> like tom and me are currently working "in" the wiki team
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">12:26:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so the wiki team needs to blog about what they
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">12:26:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> others work in other teams
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">12:26:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> so spread the love, enlighten us to the other teams are doing and where they need help, what issues
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">12:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> aah ok, yes, that makes sense
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">12:27:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Ok so define for me now.  What is the role of a booster person in relation to other teams?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">12:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> henne, i agree it isnt just a matter for the boosters
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">12:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> in general, more blogs about what is going on is good - as long as it is vaguely interesting...
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">12:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> do something
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">12:27:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> but let's look at it as a form of mentoring
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">12:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> like I did for the openFATE topic last week, with very limited response
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">12:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> we need to lead by example
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">12:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> "do something" as in "work when others aren't"  or do something as in "we boost more involvement into this team or activity"?
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">12:28:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> dragotin, you wont always get a response, which can be *very* frustrating
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">12:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> but consistency is key
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">12:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we push teams forward. that can mean anything. from kicking off something to maturing something to phase out something
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">12:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this is not a process. its people :)
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">12:29:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> or we clean up stuff we inherited from former suse times, such as openFATE, nice example
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">12:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">12:29:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and try to make it interesting for a broader audience
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">12:29:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then I guess I have a little confusion about the meaning of "boosters"   My perception of its lofty goal seems different than reality
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">12:30:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> suseROCKs, they "boost" just like nitros does in a car
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">12:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can you elaborate?
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">12:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> FunkyPenguin,   heh
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">12:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> does that make sense?
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">12:31:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   well by "boost"  I really thought it was more about "boosting community awarenenss, involvement, etc."    That the boosters team was a path to motivating the community at large
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">12:31:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> that's jospoortvliet's job ;)
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">12:31:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> please read our eam page
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">12:31:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> team
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">12:31:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but now I see it based on what's been said here, is that the boosters are simply the added manpower needed to sustain any given project
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">12:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no, they are supposed to improve the infrastructure to make contributing easier
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">12:32:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> lower the bar for newcomers
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">12:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> mostly focussing on technical solutions to that
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">12:32:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> help struggeling teams
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">12:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> kick-off technical solutions
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">12:32:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so its the nitro thing.   Okay
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">12:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we, as in you and me and other marketing/promo/communicaton ppl should do the more social part of that, guide new contributors etc
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">12:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and now I need food, it's 1438 and I haven't had lunch yet
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">12:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so screw ya'll and cu later
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">12:33:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   yes, agreed.  And that's what I want to figure out here, how and where we, the marketing team, can help give the boosters some fuel for their nitro-firing.  :-)
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">12:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so in general: Yes we could be better in posting meeting results. Yes all team (inkluding those we work in) could blog more
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">12:34:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> not only meeting, also activity reports
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">12:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> same for the marketing guys, strategy guys, artwork, wiki, whoever
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">12:34:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> if anything activity is more important than meeting
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">12:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> We are doing bla and it goes foo.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">12:34:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the meeting is the condensed activity report for the last 2 weeks :)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">12:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think activity is more interesting to talk about than meeting
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">12:34:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> in our case, yes
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">12:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> i talk about our case. the question was about our case...
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">12:35:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> yes my darling
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">12:36:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sheesh, how many people is henne darling to?  I'm losing track here
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">12:36:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> so does that answer your question? :)
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">12:36:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wait... what was the question again?   :-)
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">12:36:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> AI take, I will kick more after blogs
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">12:38:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm  there is a lull in the meeting, this is unlike henne to allow such lulls  :-)
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">12:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I have a question....
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">12:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> shoot :)
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">12:39:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Now that jospoortvliet has left the room to go get some lunch, can we ask him right now to give us a speech right now?  :-)
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">12:39:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> no, his mouth is full ;-)
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">12:40:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, And his hands are busy to keep that state ;)
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">12:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I have a question too
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">12:41:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok well... I'd just like to remind everyone that we, the Board, will also be having our meeting today at 18:00 UTC in this channel.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">12:41:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I hear people from (still) outside the community saying that our mailinglist has lots and lots of useless traffic, probably influenced from the strategy discussion
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">12:42:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I would be interested if there is a way to calm that down and bring to a kind of result
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">12:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Sj&gt;</span> thats one of the reason I read less of mails these days :-)
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">12:42:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I feel that this is not good for the project, honestly#
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">12:43:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> you read olav vitters blog?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">12:43:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span>  thats says ppl inside the project too ;)
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">12:43:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> do they mention any specific list?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">12:43:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> yes, for example
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">12:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> it's just one guy, with another distribution's culture
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">12:44:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I think that has reached a level now were we need to become active
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">12:44:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> even though I have no good idea how to fix that
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">12:44:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> that might be true
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">12:44:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Olav speaks about "development mailing lists" so that would not apply to project - but I see the point for project as well
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">12:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> such behaviours are easy to enforce on technical lists
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">12:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> how do you police that on a project list though?
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">12:45:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> its not about policing a list
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">12:45:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> its about moving the strategy discussion forward in a constructive way
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">12:46:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> well, we probably can not find a solution for that here
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">12:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> tbh everyone who should be doing that appears to be awol on the strategy threads lately
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">12:46:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but I think its an issue
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">12:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> is it vacation time?
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">12:47:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, if you have ideas on how to move the strategy discussion forward, you can reach the team via strategy@opensuse.org
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">12:47:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> also consider we are a very diverse bunch on the project lists
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">12:47:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> there will always be friction and useless chatter threads
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">12:48:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> right now it's a soapbox for anyone who thinks they outgrew opensuse@opensuse.org to share their opinions.
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">12:48:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> we're not there yet that we can conclude the strategy for good, this is far more involved than expected
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">12:49:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> but you're still sure that that we're on the right way to come to a good strategy?
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">12:49:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> wstephenson, and for some of the discussions we should let them die or say something to end them
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">12:50:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> 1. +1, 2, +0.5 - there are not many discussions that really need terminated. unlike on opensuse@.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">12:50:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i have the same feeling as dragotin
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">12:50:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, I hope that we get their but I sometimes I have doubts
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">12:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i'm not so sure anymore that this strategy task is doing us ANY good
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">12:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  We are taking a lot of the comments to heart on strategy, and that, I believe, is putting us on the right path to a good strategy.   But like AJ said, its more complex than we assumed and we're taking a measured approach to it rather than rushing into a strategy just for the sake of a strategy statement
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">12:51:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> henne / dragotin yes thal you very much :)
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">12:51:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, we'd like to have a discussion face to face during the conference on the strategy - we think that's the best way to move fowrad
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">12:51:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> good. i think the process as initially envisages is not sufficient to handle the problem.
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">12:52:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, and we have to take care that the whole thing does not harm the project overall
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">12:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   That's definitely a concern of ours.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">12:53:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">12:54:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> i think part of the issue is people not really understanding what -project is used for
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">12:54:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> i'm concerned that the strategy process design and strategy decision process is too closed to be legitimate
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">12:54:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> yes there is a lot of traffic re strategy, but i dont think -project is a developer's ml per se
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">12:55:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> +1
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">12:55:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> depends on your definition of developer...
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">12:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> developer or contributor?
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">12:55:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> (yes, back, but mouth full)
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">12:56:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> its not really relevant if developer list or not, the question is if we do something productive on it
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">12:56:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway i don't think we will change the perception of people of the -project list in this meeting
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">12:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">12:56:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> wstephenson, there was  a lot of closed discussion but now we have an open discussion - and we proposed to have a vote in the end.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">12:56:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and if people think that our lists are trolls home, we have a problem
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">12:56:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> that isnt so true anymore is it?
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">12:56:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> wstephenson, you cannot make such a discussion completely in the open as you see right now on -project. Do you have a better proposal?
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">12:56:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> but on something like strategy, which is vague and all-compassing, troll-like comments are to be expected
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">12:57:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> sure
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">12:57:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> i don't think that you can take outsiders' comments on our internal community list too seriously.
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">12:57:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't see how we can avoid "troll" comments.    One man's troll, is another man's valid comments.
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">12:57:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> i would measure success on is our -project community healthy and growing
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">12:58:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I would appreciate it if ppl whould start thinking about the strategy proposals and write good analysis about them on the blogs. If you feel strongly about it, let the community know your view.
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">12:58:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> to us, a microsoft developers' list looks like a bunch of clueless monkeys, right?
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">12:58:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> doesn't that disrupt the -project@ discussion?
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">12:58:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> most ppl read the planet
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">12:58:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> besides the discussion should be as wide as possilbe
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">12:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ble
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">12:58:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> through many channels
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">12:58:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> yes, but thats just another medium pulled in
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">12:58:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> not everyone reads -project
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">12:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> sure, so?
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">12:59:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> didn't it have to be more open?
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">12:59:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then talk about it everywhere...
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">12:59:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> and it's one where it's harder to have a real discussion, just competing soapboxes
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">12:59:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> get input from ppl, make them feel heard (by responsing to others, what they said etc)
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">12:59:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">12:59:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> in the end the discussion will be apparently 'won' by whoever gets the most 'Yeah dude' comments.
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">12:59:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">12:59:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but here's another example of what might be considered troll...  Yesterday someone posted to come over to Forums to observe discussions about codecs installation.  I assumed there was going to be some kind of meaningful discussion about how to improve the process, but instead when I got there, it was just more harping about codecs without any meaningful solution proposals.
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">13:00:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, saw that too
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">13:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> boah, amazing stuff
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">13:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> that's where voting comes in, that's where the strategy team comes in
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">13:00:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> the discussion should be wide, everyone should talk and think about it
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">13:01:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so you go from a small discussion to wide
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">13:01:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> very wide
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">13:01:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> even more wider
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">13:01:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then some peeps should start to consolidate it
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">13:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> make it smaller again
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">13:01:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and smaller

<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">13:01:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> vote :D
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">13:01:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> (smallest being at the opensuse conference)
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">13:01:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> I disagree, not choosing is also a choice
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">13:02:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and a bad one at that
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">13:02:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, I would still lvoe to see writtin now what the current status is.
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">13:02:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> exactly
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">13:02:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> at least have some image of where we stand
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">13:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> We currently have not written down what we do.
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">13:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and honestly I think that's what it is coming to anyway
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">13:02:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> The "Status Quo" proposal tries to do that but I'm not happy with the current wording.
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">13:03:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's put it another way, guys and gals....
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">13:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> dragotin, I consider already the "Community Statement" a step forward, we've never stated anything that clear...
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">13:03:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we constantly hear the other guy is better at this or that.   And we don't do a good job of defining what it is that openSUSE is better at.    That's really the ultimate goal of the strategy discussions.    It isn't to decide how exactly we'll do our job in the future, but to clarify who we are and what our direction is.
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">13:05:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> from this discussion it's clear there is still a need for a good statement about the why, how and what of the strategy discussion
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">13:05:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> thats correct
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">13:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> cuz if theze dudes aren't convinced yet, I bet many others won't be either
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">13:06:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> Ok how about this
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">13:06:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> let me do something this time
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">13:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but not just me
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">13:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> dragotin, wstephenson, AJaeger you all have strong opinions on this
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">13:06:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and that's why we're taking everyone's comments to heart and looking at how we can coalesce everyone's perceptions in a meaningful and feasible way.
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">13:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> you to henne or are you ok with what is happening?
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">13:07:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> ???
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">13:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok he doesn't like me anymore, fine
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">13:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i have
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">13:08:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think henne walked off in personal shock, he's never run a meeting in -project this long before  :-)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">13:08:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so you think the strategy thing is needed and being done right?
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">13:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nope
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">13:08:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> nope to both?
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">13:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> wrong answer
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">13:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> now you have to join
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">13:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i have stated my opinion from the beginning
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">13:08:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think what we are trying to get to is "image"
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">13:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so I propose wstephenson dragotin AJaeger henne and me to have a joint meeting in real life (higher bandwith) and come up with a draft explaining why the strategy is needed and how it is being done
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">13:09:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and that one you don't define
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">13:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> maybe propose improvmeents but that's beside the goal
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">13:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> only throgh action
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">13:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then send it to -strategy mailinglist for others to comment, kurt wanted to do such a doc, we can give him a draft this way
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">13:09:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> ok, I will be there
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">13:09:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but thats just me :)

<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">13:10:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so what time?
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">13:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> 16:30?
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">13:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> as long as the result is just a draft, so that those not able to be present in real life are not excluded.
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">13:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> of course
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">13:10:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that's surely the idea
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">13:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> kurt was supposed to write it anyway we'll give it to him
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">13:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> pity llunak is on holiday, he gave the best analysis of what's wrong with the process
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">13:10:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I just want to make sure it is convincing for some strong critics, if it convinces you guys it should be OK
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">13:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> yep
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">13:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> llunak had a good write up on the mailinglist
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">13:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I want more of those, supportive to the effort or not doesn't matter
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">13:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> as long as it's well thought out and open

<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">13:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> if you know anyone else with strong opinions on the strategy matter tell him/her to join
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">13:13:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well here's what I would ask of you guys in that meeting ....
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">13:14:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> since the purpose of the meeting is to discuss whether the need for a strategy is valid, I would ask that you focus specifically on that and not let the discussion detract into the validity of any specific proposals.
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">13:14:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we'll surely focus on that
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">13:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, _the_ important point
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">13:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but we're nerds, we can't stay on topic
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">13:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> now wstephenson henne can I get a 'I'll be there at 16:30' from you?

<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">13:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I just think that in general, because some of the proposals were viewed somewhat alienating, it detracted people from grasping the need for strategy vs. content of any specific strategy.  If we can get back to "need" then I think we can get back on track
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">13:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> henne, won't work for me.  I can try 16:00
