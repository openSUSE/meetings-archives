<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">16:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Teams and individuals send various status reports around. Coolo sends one for the distribution, the OBS team publishes meeting minutes, the boosters their "What are the boosters up to" blogposts, the board has a public meeting and so on and so on. Are there any questions regarding those or do we need to discuss anything in detail?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:04:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> umm  hang on dude
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> to your strap on?

<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:05:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Two of those items got inadverntely assigned to me ages ago and shouldn't have been.   And should have been removed.  (Wiki related)

<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   know what?  I think that last item was related to gnome meetings, not project meetings,  so should remove that one too.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:09:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> im closing them

<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">16:32:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So I'm hearing various comments out there about the new wiki, and certainly its understandable that with any change comes some form of disruption and dissatisfaction
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">16:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But I'm concerned about some of those too.   Search issues, pages not completely migrated yet, confusion about where to place things...   How will these issues be addressed?     Seems there's a rather high bar here.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">16:33:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> education? :)
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">16:33:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as with all new things...
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">16:34:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Look at me for example, I had to ask around for a day or so before getting an answer from you about proper placement on the wiki
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">16:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> well, lots of redirects are missing/broken
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">16:34:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> search does not look into openSUSE: namespace
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">16:34:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> these two are affecting a lot of people
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">16:35:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and the timing couldn't be worse imo  with the release of 11.3 and people generally going to the wiki to find answers.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">16:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> so what do you suggest?
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">16:35:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but all of that we have to move beyond, no point in criticism.   My question centers on how can we ease this all going forth.
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">16:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we blogged, we educate individuals
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">16:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> how about adding openSUSE NS to search by default ?
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">16:36:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> or is this not wanted ?
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">16:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> why would we? we explicitely left it out because we want to focus on the consumers by default
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">16:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i had a good usecase yesterday
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">16:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> currently we are trying to come up with a concept to integrate google search
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">16:37:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but what I experience myself and read on ml sound to me that this is not the perfect solution
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">16:37:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> can't recall today
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">16:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> its not a solution its a decision :)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I struggled yesterday searching for the logos on the new wiki until Rajko helped me find it
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">16:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maybe even a decision should get a 2nd thought
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">16:38:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> without new arguments?
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">16:39:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean. yes we turned off search for the project namespace
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">16:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   isn't the fact that some of us are having trouble finding and navigating and understanding things an argument?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">16:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> if the argument: "users don't get it" isn't enough - me wonders
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">16:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and yes that means people need to do something differently now
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">16:40:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> users?
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">16:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we explicitely tried what we try with the strategy and stuff

I am not asking you to revert or stop what you're doing but to see if we can further find some middle ground to achieve your goals but not make visitors to the wiki feel alienated.  And many feel tht way now

<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">16:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> look  maybe this is too big of a discussion for the project meeting itself and another time should be focused on wiki discussion (here in -project channel)
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">16:42:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no this is perfect for the project meeting i think

<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">16:42:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and i would like to discuss it
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">16:42:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so our (wiki team) focus on consumer wrong?
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">16:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  but only on the condition we're not all acting defensively when we respond
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">16:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> should we give it up and make it easier for contributors to find stuff?

<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">16:47:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> on what which people try to find
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">16:47:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> shouldn't you be able to find anything you need to find on a wiki?
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">16:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if you (contributor) say you cant find logos (promo material, contributor stuff) anymore
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">16:48:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its to be expected when we shift the focus to consumers by default
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">16:48:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> right?
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">16:48:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> especially in a time where people are used to search engines finding everything
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">16:48:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but consumers themselves may want to find the logo too.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">16:48:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> why?
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">16:49:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> maybe they love openSUSE so much (it does happen ya know? ;-) ) that they want to download the logo and create their own special wallpaper or something
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">16:49:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats the thing with focus guys...
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">16:49:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> it leaves other stuff out
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">16:49:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I mean I've downloaded logos for things even if I'm not associated with the project
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">16:49:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or what if I'm a member of the media and need to put the logo into my article when I'm writing about openSUSE?
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">16:49:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but it leaves pretty important stuff out, eg. conference, ambassador etc.
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">16:50:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sorry  i don't get it
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">16:50:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It's too myopic to say only this type of user will want this piece of information.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">16:50:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what is your argument? that we should focus on consumers but should show them ambassador pages?
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">16:51:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> consumers eventuall (hopefully) become contributors.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">16:51:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> if someone searches for ambassadors why not showing him the ambassador page ?
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">16:51:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> currently a "not found" or similar is the result
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">16:52:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and he need to spend time in reading and getting it that he needs to adjust the search
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">16:52:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> this is pretty untypically nowadays - at least imo
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">16:52:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's a good point about ambassadors.  A consumer may wish to contact an ambassador.
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">16:53:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then maybe ambassadors need to go into the main namespace which is searched by default
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">16:53:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't know.
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">16:53:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes! i remember
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">16:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i was looking for "launch party" in the wiki
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">16:53:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> quiet everybody...  let prusnak remember1
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">16:53:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the point is: consumers searching on the old wiki wont find ANY usefull information
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">16:53:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and I failed
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">16:53:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> including openSUSE: in the default search would just do that
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">16:54:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> but you need to know
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">16:54:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> and you need to select out of 10 or so choices
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">16:54:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,  I don't think anyone disputes that there were issues with the old wiki.  I think what we're trying to ask is... did we solve or improve from the old wiki, and too many people are unsure of that right now.
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">16:55:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> my point is people expect from  a search on a page nowadays more
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">16:55:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> what's not found there in first place isn't there
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">16:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but we can only use whats there right?
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">16:56:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I honestly don't understand that question.

<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">17:03:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> thats the blog part. it operates difdferently from the web-age part :)
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">17:03:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">17:03:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's why I said I don't know how quickly the wiki gets indexed.
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">17:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anyway. we are looking into making the search better
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">17:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we've identified taht we have issues with search capabilities and no real quick solution
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">17:04:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but there is no real solution in sight
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">17:04:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">17:04:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> now the other issue (at least for me) is how to make it easy to understand where to go to place new articles
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">17:05:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would like to know that too
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">17:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean we have awesome documentation linked from the frontpage
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">17:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we blogged
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">17:05:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we tell individual
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">17:05:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> s
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">17:05:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what more do you think can we do?
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">17:06:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> blogging won't cut it  because not everyone who contributes an article reads the blogs.   And blogs fly by too quickly
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">17:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> accept they are out of place :)
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">17:06:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> What you wrote 2 weeks ago won't reach the new user who comes by today.
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">17:06:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> we do that too. thats the main entry point on educatin individuals for us :)
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">17:06:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> people won't read pages and pages of rules and instructions, even if they are motivated...they work for free :)
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">17:07:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span> i mean i did it with you right? :)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">17:07:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   perhaps a click point at the top of every page that says something like "Post an Article" or "Posting Guidelines"   Not just at the front page.  I rarely ever go to the front page
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">17:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">17:08:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> would the sidebar work for that too?
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">17:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Sure
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">17:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as long as its there and prominent no matter where you land in the wiki  :-)
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">17:10:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">17:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i guess we can do that
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">17:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm....  we actually came up with a solution??
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">17:10:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't think it will make a big difference...
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">17:11:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but lets try :
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">17:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> :
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">17:11:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think this needs something else entirely
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">17:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> time
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">17:11:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the third issue that I see is pages not migrated.  But that's clearly a manpower issue and not much we can do except hope and wait for everyone to finish their tasks
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">17:11:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> time for people to adapt
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">17:12:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean we had a everything-goes style wiki
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">17:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and now "all of the sudden" we have rules
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">17:12:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> that takes time to adapt to
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">17:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I agree.  that caused a problem.  And I do appreciate the issues the wiki team had to deal with
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">17:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that = "everything-goes"
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">17:13:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and i can tell you that we already now have more quality in the contributions
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">17:13:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and more people editing the wiki
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">17:14:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so hey... does anyone else have questions about the wiki  or even other questions?  If not, I think henne  and I would love to stretch our legs before the board meeting in 45 mins
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">17:14:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> damn 45 mins, I already need 30 to cycle home
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">17:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> get cycling dude!
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">17:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think i have one point to say still
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">17:15:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i find the style and the tone in which the wiki switch gets discussed VERY irritating
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">17:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   You're not going to talk about my body odor again, are you?
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">17:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   even in today's meeting now?
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">17:16:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> I mean I'm very deeply rooted in this project
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">17:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> in general, here, ?
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">17:16:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and i will think twice to do something like that again
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">17:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   In general, its always the way that people who have negative reactions will speak the loudest and keep their foot in their mouths.   That's to be expected everywhere.
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">17:17:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But in today's meeting, I hope that at least I came at this discussion in an objective way
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">17:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> in general
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">17:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes but what do you think will guys like tim or dominian take away from this?
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">17:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> those two are new awesome contributors
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">17:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> ya, i saw some the more unfriendly and rude statements made
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">17:18:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i can take this. i'll manage
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">17:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   how do you and I take away from this when I constantly hear accusations that we board are making decisions behind closed doors when a) everything we do is in public  b) we rarely ever see each other in non public situations?
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">17:19:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you and i are oldtimers
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">17:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we _know_ and _experienced_ that working here is rewarding
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">17:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> people who wish to wear tin foil hats are dead set on assuming the worst in everything.   And we have to take it and move on.   Tim and dominian have to take that with a grain of salt.  It's the dark side of public living in open source but it exists.
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">17:20:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you, henne  as a team member then have an  obligation to comfort and support them so they understand.  And down the line they'll do the same for newcomers
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">17:20:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i have to disagree. i don't think we can continue like that
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">17:21:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but maybe this si something for the board meeting later
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">17:21:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> contributing for suse rewarding? well, I beg to differ, deeply :)
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">17:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay lets wrap this up
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">17:22:58 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">assumes michl  is already cycling</span>
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">17:23:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> not yet
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">17:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anything else we need to discuss?
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">17:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we ran everyone else off  :-)
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">17:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> Okay that's it then. If you have more, don't hesitate to bring it up on the appropriate mailinglist.
