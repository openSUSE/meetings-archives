16:00:33 <henne> #meetingtopic Welcome to the openSUSE Project Meeting!
16:00:37 <henne> Welcome to the openSUSE Project Meeting!
16:00:42 <henne> This meeting is meant to discuss the latest developments in and around openSUSE.
16:00:47 <henne> The topics for this meeting are:
16:01:00 <henne> 1. Old Action Items
16:01:00 <henne> 2. Status Reports
16:01:00 <henne> 3. Questions & Answers
16:01:14 <michl> henne: I see, you have been even 22 secs too late. you need to improve on beeing on time ;-)
16:01:18 <henne> #topic Old Action Items
16:01:40 <henne> #info you can find the old action items in bugzilla with this link: http://bit.ly/opensuse_action_items
16:01:51 <henne> any progress there?
16:02:42 <michl> the one assigned to me on information to the package ml I can just give an update on postponing the activity
16:03:04 <michl> due to the fact that the junior job sprint status is unclear as is the status of additional QA docu
16:03:29 <henne> michl: the status for sprints you always find on the boosters ml :)
16:03:31 <michl> if we know more about that & the Indian students its worth blowing the whistle
16:03:39 <michl> henne: hihi
16:04:19 <henne> michl: the latest is this: http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-boosters/2010-08/msg00082.html
16:04:54 <michl> henne: Sir, thank you, Sir!
16:05:12 <henne> michl: but its not looking good and i wouldnt wait for this for the students
16:05:24 <henne> michl: especially not for the announcement
16:06:11 <michl> henne: but if there is no easy entry path for the students we don't have anything to announce nor should attract those students
16:06:21 <michl> so its an chicken egg thing
16:06:39 <henne> michl: the junior jobs page is abot easy discovery of the entries
16:07:03 <henne> michl: we have a lot of entries and we handle this without a webapp :)
16:07:04 <michl> exactly
16:08:09 <henne> so don't wait for the boosters sprint to finish
16:08:14 <henne> good?
16:08:28 <michl> henne: no good
16:09:03 <henne> hm?
16:09:23 <michl> in general a simple not manual entry would be helpful
16:09:39 <michl> for these Indian students as for any one else new to openSUSE
16:09:46 <henne> we have several simple entries
16:09:50 <henne> just not all on one page
16:10:08 <henne> and the JJ sprint is about automatic generation of this page
16:10:11 <michl> henne: so tell me where I can find which packages are there to be updated ?
16:10:45 <henne> https://build.opensuse.org/project/status?project=openSUSE:Factory
16:11:23 <michl> k - so I'll put this link to the "how to participate" page
16:12:15 <henne> yes. we can do a lot manually and don't have to wait for the sprint. as i said 10 minutes ago ;)
16:13:38 <henne> okay?
16:13:45 <michl> okay as usually
16:14:05 <henne> wonderfull
16:14:48 <henne> as there are no other action items left we can continue i guess
16:16:48 <henne> #info we discussed the only action item (#634456) and agreed on going forward without waiting for the boosters junior jobs sprint
16:16:59 <henne> #topic Status Reports
16:16:59 <michl> henne: damned - my wiki knowledge is not good enough to update the how to participate page
16:17:27 <henne> #info Teams and individuals send various status reports around. Coolo sends one for the distribution, the OBS team publishes meeting minutes, the boosters their "What are the boosters up to" blogposts, the board has a public meeting and so on and so on.
16:17:28 * michl leaves as is and don't care about adding value
16:17:34 <henne> Are there any questions regarding those or do we need to discuss anything in detail?
16:17:54 <henne> michl: can we do that after the meeting or tomorrow?
16:18:19 <henne> for instance coolo's hidden announcement of our change to build factory
16:19:28 <henne> #info coolo's "announcement" for the scheduler changes http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2010-09/msg00119.html
16:21:03 <henne> is ANYONE awake except michl and me?
16:21:51 <henne> is michl still awake?
16:21:57 * michl is
16:22:03 * prusnak reading too
16:22:04 * k0da here
16:22:18 * metalgod awake too
16:22:28 <henne> phew :)
16:23:22 <henne> prusnak: how about a nice live report from froscamp? :)
16:23:44 <prusnak> live report? I did blogpost
16:23:49 <prusnak> do you want me to record mp3 ? :D
16:24:32 <prusnak> okay, here I go ...
16:24:33 <henne> no i want you to tell us what happened :)
16:24:50 <prusnak> it was just the first year of froscamp
16:25:02 <prusnak> so it didn't have too many visitors when compared to other conferences
16:25:23 <prusnak> lots of FOSS projects were presenting though
16:25:51 <henne> more talks then booth's?
16:26:05 <prusnak> there were around ~20 booths
16:26:19 <prusnak> two talk tracks + 2 fudcon tracks
16:27:11 <henne> how was fudcon? :)
16:27:36 <prusnak> fudcon was OK, but when I compare it to last years fudcon during linuxtag, it was smaller as well
16:28:07 <prusnak> talks were ok, but some of them very fedora specific :-)
16:28:10 <henne> how many people would you say?
16:28:26 <prusnak> visitors ?
16:28:37 <gnokii_> more then at the ubuntu booth thats is sure
16:28:47 <prusnak> :)
16:28:59 <henne> no i mean at fudcon
16:29:11 <prusnak> it's hard to say, because it was in the same area
16:29:23 <AlbertoP> gnokii_: that's because Geeko is sexier than those three guys in a circle ;-)
16:29:24 <prusnak> but i would guess around 80
16:29:24 <gnokii_> registered was for fudcon more then last fudcon in berlin round 120
16:30:08 <prusnak> 120 registered means around 80-100 I guess
16:30:14 <henne> k
16:30:14 <prusnak> thanks gnokii_ for the numbers
16:30:36 <gnokii_> yes there was guys registered like Jan Wildeboer and JÃ¶rg Simon both wasnt there
16:30:55 <prusnak> sure, you always have some people that register and don't come
16:31:26 <prusnak> to summarize, it was a nice event, rather small in visitors, but it gave us more opportunity to talk at booths
16:31:42 <henne> thanks for the report :)
16:31:54 <prusnak> you're welcome
16:32:03 <gnokii_> henne likes not to read blogs
16:32:17 <henne> i like to discuss things
16:32:38 <henne> this is the time & place to discuss things :)
16:32:56 <henne> okay maybe we have any other status report?
16:32:57 <gnokii_> ooh np then let us discuss participation for clt in march and for openrheinruhr I could some helping hands need too
16:33:59 <henne> sure. bring up the topic and we do
16:34:12 <henne> so no other status reports. good
16:34:41 <henne> #info pavol told us what happened on froscamp
16:34:54 <henne> #topic Question and Answers
16:35:03 <henne> #info there were no questions on the wiki
16:35:23 <henne> lets discuss CLT and openrheinruhr as requested by gnokii_
16:36:00 <gnokii_> for openrheinruhr booth is accepted, we are 3 for that right now, but more would be better
16:36:28 <gnokii_> for clt its the same week like 11.4 would be released so would be great to use that event for an big push
16:37:20 <prusnak> CLT is in march ?
16:38:00 <henne> so around march 3rd?
16:38:01 <gnokii_> yes, I spoke with Jos about it, the offer one room for extra and it would be great to offer the organizers a complete program for this room
16:38:20 <gnokii_> no, since cebit is that date its not mor the firs weekend in march
16:38:30 <prusnak> i guess Michal and I could come to CLT, it is rather close from Prague
16:38:41 <gnokii_> should be 12 &13th march
16:39:15 <prusnak> no support for openrheinruhr, though
16:39:15 <henne> i don't see us pulling off a devroom while we do a release
16:39:32 <gnokii_> henne: no dev room!
16:39:40 <gnokii_> its not the same like froscon
16:39:52 <prusnak> henne: i guess gnokii_ means separate opensuse track
16:40:00 <gnokii_> prusnak: yes
16:40:12 <prusnak> gnokii_: are you talking about CLT ?
16:40:20 <gnokii_> yes I do
16:41:16 <henne> yes whatever we do in it
16:41:26 <henne> i don't see us pulling it off
16:42:26 <prusnak> we can send some talks, but i don't think it will be enough for the whole room
16:43:28 <gnokii_> mmh, wehn we use the room for 3 h workshops we can only 3 of them in it so it needs not really a lot of ppl
16:43:55 <henne> yes but workshops require a significant amount of preparation
16:44:11 <henne> and we all know how it is around a release
16:44:25 <henne> and what if we have to slip or something
16:45:30 <prusnak> to wrap it up, we'll send as many talks as possible, but i'm afraid we can't promise the organizers to fill up the whole room
16:46:13 <henne> yeah i think so too
16:46:52 <gnokii_> then comes the same participation out like all years before
16:47:11 <henne> it is like it is. isn't it?
16:48:24 <gnokii_> mmh
16:48:36 <henne> what about openrheinruhr?
16:49:20 <gnokii_> as I said the booth is accepted, my talks/workshop I dont know yet. We are right now 3 ppl for booth
16:49:38 <henne> who would that be?
16:49:49 <henne> you, thomas and?
16:49:51 <gnokii_> thomas, lurik and me
16:50:09 <henne> do you need anything?
16:50:31 <henne> else then more participants
16:50:54 <henne> touchsmarts or whatever
16:50:55 <gnokii_> a package with DVD and stuff definitly I have only round 15 DVD
16:51:37 <michl> gnokii_: how many do you need ?
16:51:39 <gnokii_> would be nice to use the hp but it means to drive over Nue
16:51:51 <henne> gnokii_: we can ship one to you
16:52:37 <gnokii_> think 200 DVD are more then enough for this event and 5 geekos (for the organizer girls)
16:52:56 <michl> the usual address, right ?
16:53:02 <gnokii_> henne: that I cant decide this week thomas is in scotland
16:53:31 <gnokii_> michl: yes but it has time because ORR is after Conference ;)
16:53:49 <michl> yes, but what's done is done ;-)
16:54:19 <gnokii_> so u can spare the money for sending, we can take it with us
16:54:23 <henne> gnokii_: okay. let me know. its definately possible!
16:55:11 <henne> okay anything else we need to discuss?
16:55:16 <henne> any questions?
16:55:29 <gnokii_> yeah henne will do but before I think on ORR I have to prepare BLIT :D
16:55:50 <henne> sure
16:56:05 <suseROCKs> Bacon Lettuce Innards Tomato sandwich?
16:56:30 <henne> okay then lets wrap this up
16:57:00 <henne> #info we discussed what we want to do at CLT 2011 and ORR in november
16:57:16 <henne> Okay that's it then. If you have more, don't hesitate to bring it up on the appropriate mailinglist.
16:57:29 <henne> #info The next project meeting will be in two weeks. Same channel but this time at 12:00 UTC.
16:57:29 <gnokii_> maybe Adrian can give an nice OBS workshop at CLT
