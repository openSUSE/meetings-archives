<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   What's your feeling, without making an official statement on the matter, about our chances of moving ahead with Plan A?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:13:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> did everyone review the 400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 pages document michl sent around?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:13:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> on the openSUSE foundation I sent you stuff around
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Not yet :-)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:14:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hint:</span> the short one is good to go
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so Jos, Alan, aj and myself have the honour to present this in Markus Rex staff meeting this Friday
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> tasks of the foundation is just "book keeping" = collecting and spreading donation
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and give legal support to the project if necessary
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:15:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> legal support?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:15:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> define legal support?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:15:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> technical decisions won't be a duty of the foundation
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:16:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> who will retain technical decisions?
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:16:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> technical decisions?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> technical decisions stay as of today
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maintainer, release manager
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> That actually brings up an interesting aspect to question.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm not sure if its going to tear into this discusssion though.  It could get a bit sensitive to bring up
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but first, the question of legal support.   How does the Foundation, in the capacity you just describe, become the legal support of the Project?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and what means legal support?
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> there is nothing such thing as a legal support
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we need an entity where people can donate their resources
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:18:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> (be them financial or not)
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> if someone comes around the corner and claims hey, your violating my IP
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I think the "legal support" alludes to providing legal advice to questions that arise from the Project.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and we don't want this to be novell, because a) it has not a very good reputation in the public
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:19:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> b) some things are not possible if the second party is a company not NPF
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> that's my POV
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:20:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I personally don't see how the Foundation can provide legal support, and would consider Novell to be a donor of legal support to the Project.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:20:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> unfortunately I think you're right
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:21:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> as from a code perspectice kind of anything is in openSUSE is in one or the other way in a Novell product
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> at some point in the future when we really bring in money and support we'll either pay it ourselves and/or get pro bono services
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so they'd take care
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:21:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so whats this task about then?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:22:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i don't get it
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> its on trademarks
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:23:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so legal support = we have the authority to manage the trademarks
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> the Foundation will sign a contract with Novell on trademarks
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:23:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and defer to Novell as the donor of legal services when a legal question about the trademarks arises.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:23:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so anyone asking today the Board for tm usage will then go to the Foundation
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:24:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok that makes more sense
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:24:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> so Novell owns the tm furthermore
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> if novell will be willing to gave the rights to the foundation
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:25:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> if they don't decide to make a gift to the foundation yes
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:25:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,   It would be as it currently exists...  Novell owns, but openSUSE is the exclusive manager of it.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:26:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> THE duty of the foundation would be collecting and spreading donations
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> in other words supporting the openSUSE project
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:26:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> travel, hardware, services etc
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I have to bring up another aspect, since technically michl already brought it up.  I think it bears at least some discussion....
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> contains the contract a paragraph what would be with the tm when novell is not anymore the owner of it?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:27:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> as the contract isn't yet written there is nothing in
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:27:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,   Those are minute details that haven't been worked on yet.  First step is to sell Novell to support our concept of Foundation.  Then next step is legal wording mumbo-jumbo
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but those "what would happen if" sentences is kind of core of any lawyers
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> so when Novell sells SUSE we have on the end no guarantee of openSUSE or?
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dev001&gt;</span> i'm not on the board, obviously, but i'll just inject -- doesn't this line of inquiry depend in _large_ part on who ends up buying/owning Novell?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> we don't even have guarantee the there will be sunrise tomorrow
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:28:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dev001&gt;</span> ah ...
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dev001:</span> gnokii_: good points
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:29:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i am afraid all this discussion with novell can go down the drain and we'll have to talk with the new "owners"
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:29:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> right
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and please understand there will be no contract :)
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:29:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but looking from the brighter side the new talks might be easier than the ones with novell :)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dev001,   Maybe yes, maybe no.   But we can't just sit around and wait.   We're going forth and whatever responses we get, we'll react accordingly.  We are already devising a plan B in case we don't get a support and do not want to delay the creation of such a Foundation.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:30:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> why would the new "owners" employ someone else than markus and why would the new owners have a different stance on something that is already decided?
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:30:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> btw, I talked with Fedora guys last weekend and they HAVE a foundation!
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I agree on "possible improvement."  If there is indeed a strategic partner, then surely they recognize the value of openSUSE.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dev001&gt;</span> it's also entirely possible, if not likely, that the @novell/@suse team members may well -- change.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> they decided to cancel US one, but they still have Fedora EMEA foundation
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:30:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dev001&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> cref: oracle &amp; opensolaris
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:30:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> for organizing events in europe and so on ...
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:30:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes but they have not such a problem with TM because fedora != RedHat
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:31:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so the argument "why we need foundation if redhat does not" is in fact not valid
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:31:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dev001:</span> if we present on friday to markus and we decide to go forward its a done deal
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:31:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but let's not bog ourselves down on who's buying what, and what the contract specificity says.  The important thing right now is that we SELL the idea of a Foundation.   We need to get past that first hurdle before we do anything else
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:31:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> prusnak about EMEA foundation thats right now in discussion to kill it
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dev001&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> nobody's suggested sitting around and waiting.  simply, being rational about the fact that a sale/change of ownership is imminent.  as in very soon.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:31:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can please keep this out of this discussion?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:32:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> who cares really?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:32:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dev001,   While many of us believe the news is true, it is still only officially a rumor with n o official news validating it.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:32:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> you scared him :)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:32:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we have a meeting with people on friday

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> which one?
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:34:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> for preperation purpose
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:34:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and this comes to mind something I've been thinking about in last two weeks ever since I saw a response from GP on one of the threads
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:34:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> in his thread, he stated that openSUSE is an independent project and not owned by Novell.
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> btw, i'm getting 504s on piratepad :-/
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:35:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Now I happen to agree there's a lot of FUD about just how much Novell controls the Project, henne.   You know that.
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:35:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> I can send you the document
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:35:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But, how will we truly get support for a Foundation if its just a "put our hands out and beg for money" entity than a driver of the project if there's still some control by Novell?
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> spit it out
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:36:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   I have very long spittle... live with it.  :-)
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what is a driver of the project?
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> at the reins
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:37:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> decision maker
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> project shaper
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whihc decision?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:37:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> whatever you wanna call it
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> pretty much drive -if not all - for the project comes from the people doing the work
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:38:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> all of the drive
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:38:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   You mentioned  "technical decision"
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> don't get me wrong i want to know. but please be specific
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:38:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's take last year's Default Debate as an example.   This was a decision made by Novell
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:38:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> how decides today which version of package or if we ship btrfs ?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:39:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no it was michls decision
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:39:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> right
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:39:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   Check michl's employment  :-)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:39:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> its ok would there be a Technical Steering Commission liek on fedora?
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> so?
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:39:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> believe it or not - there were no pressure or anyhing
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:40:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and no support ;)
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:40:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and please remember Novell's default desktop still is GNOME
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:40:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,  has the right idea here
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:40:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> this is valid point
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:40:44 </span><span class="nka">* michl</span> <span class="ac">just had a conversation today with aj about that</span>
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and nobody has a problem with this
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> decisions are still viewed as being made by Novell.   And the question is who is the entity in power of decisions?   Who makes or breaks?  Who does the tie-breaking?
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:41:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> if we want to do that, we do that
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:41:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> as how those technical decisions are taken is not very clear from an outside perspecive
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:41:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but this is the thing: viewed.
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> thank you michl
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:41:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we are talking abour: made
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:41:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   that's the point... perception.  How can we be a successful foundation raising money if we're saying "We here to take your money but we still don't get to make technical decisions"
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:41:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so yes we can change the way we decide the default desktop to whatever we want
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:42:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> roll a dice
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:42:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> throw a dart
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:42:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you name it
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:42:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this is a question of governance. not of foundation
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> A foundation can be responsible for governance
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:43:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure. so can be your mom :)
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:43:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and if we're going to end up with two boards, one for governance and one for fundraising, we're gonna have confusion galore
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:44:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats another issue isnt it?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:44:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> one that need resolving
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> mmh the fpl and his board makes no technical decisions also so whats ur problem with that?
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:44:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well it can be another issue or it can be the same issue.   Should or shouldn't the Foundation have governance role?
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:44:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we agreed on the purpose of the foundation a long time ago right?
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:44:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so no it sholdnt
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well I think we should just agree to disagree on this particular matter.
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:46:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so you don't agree anymore on the purpose of the foundation?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:47:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then we can begin a square one
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> at*
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:47:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   my interpretation of what we had always talked about for the past two years is that the foundation would be a fundraising arm as well as an official establishment of the Project as independent both perceptually and reality.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:47:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> somehow, that second part seems to have gotten lost over time.
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:48:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> u have enough knowledge u an engeneer to make technical decissions?
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:48:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> to my knowledge this is the first time you bring this up
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:48:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it will be the official establishment of the project
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:49:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but the technical decisions should be done be working groups
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:49:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   you just said it" Official establishment of the project"
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:49:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so if there is a decision about OBS let OBS people decide
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:49:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> same for factory, etc.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:50:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I'm not saying we make every decision.  But there still has to be someone who can make final decisions when agreements can't be achieved and needs someone to mediate
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:50:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we would love to have mixed groups, but unfortunately not a lot of people are interested, so it seems that novell is controlling the project
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:50:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> who's the mediator?
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">18:50:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I would reverse that.    People see it as novell controlling 9which I don't agree with that perception) and thus become uninterested
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:51:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We need a way to truly instill the feeling of empowerment.
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">18:51:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, it is a closedd circle
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">18:51:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> for now its for the distribution coolo and michl
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">18:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for the buildservice adrian and mls
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:51:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for everything else we
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">18:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> if the agreement could not be found within a group I don't thinnk that board/foundation should decide
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">18:51:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it should go back to the group for another round
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:52:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> or a technical steering body
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">18:52:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   ok  take the forums battle that occured last year.    They asked the Board to intervene and fix things.    We now lose that role as Board?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">18:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> would that be a technical decision ?
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">18:53:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> how exactly did the board fix that?
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">18:53:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so the question is. what happens to this board
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:53:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes henne
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:53:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maybe a seperation like follows:
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">18:53:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> Foundation takes care of money
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">18:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   Okay,  the decision about default.  Should that have been made by one person or should that have been made by the board?
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">18:53:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> Board takes care of Community
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">18:53:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> Steering Commitee takes care of technical decisions
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">18:54:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I'm not trying to single you out, Michl, but I think its relevant to this discussion.
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">18:54:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think everyone except me wants to merge the foundation board with this one
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">18:55:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> at least that was you guys said in the past
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">18:55:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   yes
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">18:55:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> i would merge foundation+board points into one
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">18:55:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and have technical steer as the second entity
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">18:55:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'll endorse that idea
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">18:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It will give perception that the community is empowered to drive technical aspects of the Project
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">18:56:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> an please not we have a "Steering Commitee" right now and we can transform it to whatever we want
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">18:56:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Didn't we have a plan for such a steering committee a while back?
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">18:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no one except us cares
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">18:56:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> who is "us"?
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">18:56:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> opensuse of course
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">18:57:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> please fix your spellchecker... its openSUSE   :-)
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">18:58:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so can we continue?
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">18:58:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so Foundation Board (money+commuity) and Technical Entity.  That sounds like a very logical solution
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">18:58:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we can bootstrap technical entity later
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">18:58:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> let's focus on foundation right now
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">18:58:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> +1
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">18:58:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it's much harder then technical stuff
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">19:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so is there anything missing for friday?
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">19:00:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what dress code will they follow?   :-)
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">19:00:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i guess not, i like the way it is
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">19:01:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> you will present this?

<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">19:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i feel a bit uncomfortable with this
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">19:02:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">19:02:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> as you are the only person who every took part in these discussions
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">19:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> ever*

<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">19:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well henne   It would be *nice* if a non-Novell rep was also present, but we need a Foundation first in order to pay for non-Novell rep to show up  :-)
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">19:03:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> i'm pretty sure its a phonecall :)
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:03:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I would include Alan as having been following this all along.  I'm confident of that.

<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:04:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,    But I do agree with the basis of your statement
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">19:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it has the air of "behind closed doors"  but I'm not sure how we can get around that.

<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:05:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're all going to be together on Monday before the board.   Could we request that Markus join us for such a discussion then?
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we can request everything
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> no. lets just make sure this happens in the future

<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:06:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> for present? Or for agree it?
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:07:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I would still like to have guests such as Markus present even if the presentation happens this Friday.  But we'll discuss in that topic.
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> sorry?
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:07:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,   There's nothing to agree on yet.  It is just a selling of the idea event.
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> so see for only a presentation isnt really the whole board needed
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It's a "Hey, will you join us in principle towards creating the foundation?"  And if yes, then we start working on details to agree on, and if not, then we do it ourselves in Plan B
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:08:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,   henne wasn't saying whole board needed.  He's saying he wants better representation by the board at such discussions
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:09:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> mmh I always thaught michl is the chair
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">19:10:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> what does this mean ?
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">19:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> that means the board is present there
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">19:10:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> chair != speak for everyone
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">19:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and sorry but board != Jos &amp; AJ
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">19:10:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> present a thing means not there is a discussion
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">19:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a presentation does lead to discussion.   There's always a q&amp;a.  He's not going to show a slide and then walk out of the room.
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">19:11:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you two don't have to interpret what i might mean
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">19:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i'm right here. ask me ;)
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">19:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i asked
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">19:12:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean: the people of opensuse vote on their representatives and these representatives then discuss in countless hours the foundation
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">19:13:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> brb doorbell
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">19:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and got moreorless the answer, there is no need to reinterpret what's been said
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">19:13:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure

<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">19:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> it needs only 7 ppl
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">19:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> which means (tada) club register
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">19:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we're talking of kind of 200 € or even less afaik

<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">19:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and as we're not talking about the average hobbiest foundation I'd say the bylaws need some love from an expert
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">19:21:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there are countless templates
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">19:21:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there's plenty of bylaws templates out there
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">19:21:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> templates on sport and beekeeping foundations?
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">19:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> or templates of operating sytems, free software foundations ?
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">19:22:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we look to other FOSS bylaws and use them as templates  :-)
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">19:22:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> there is at least KDE, e.V.
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">19:23:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> There ya go

<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">19:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> you only have to put in a objective of the club and then describe some means
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">19:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there is no such thing as FOSS bylaws or whatever neccesarry
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">19:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> and there is no difference to a hobbiest foundation
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">19:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> In any case, bylaws are not that complex to deal with.  I've dealt with countless over the years

<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">19:28:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But we should also have slots to invite Jos
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">19:29:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I think another slot to invite Folks in NUE  such as Markus and GP and AJ
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">19:29:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> tuesday is also pre-conf right?

<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">19:35:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> one slot for the other three I mentioned?  Or a slot for each?  I think all in one slot would be better
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">19:35:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for what?
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">19:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a agenda is something else than an appointment ;)
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">19:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well we should have a formal introduction with Jos
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">19:36:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> huh?
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">19:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> formal as in face to face

<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">19:37:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and then we can think about who to invite to talk about that
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">19:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and the slot with Jos should be to hear what he's up to, what he would like to see from us and vice versa
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">19:38:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would like to talk about his role
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">19:38:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> with him
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">19:38:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes

They mentioned it to me a number of times at Ohio Linux Fest, but kinda moot on US side as many can't afford to go across the water.
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">20:03:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can't hurt to spam them again

<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">20:04:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it might attract more people if we were able to say, hey, hurry up, we have XY sponsorship packages

<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">20:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> are you taking open questions?
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">20:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is the time for everybody to bring one up :)
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">20:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> yes of course :)
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">20:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i have one if noone else does
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">20:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> you first
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">20:15:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I definitely have one, but prusnak can go first
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">20:15:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> you go first please :)
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">20:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">20:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> question... how do we decide who goes first?  :-)
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">20:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> This may not be the proper venue for this question, however, I'm a bit curious about how the entire opensuse member process evolves.
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">20:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Mainly, as I've applied in the past, I can't apply again and my status shows "applied' etc
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">20:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Was told a while back that it meant I was still 'in process' and being' watched' lol
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">20:17:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> you apply, a group of people has a look at your contributions and votes
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">20:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Right, which I was voted on MONTHS ago.. so does the vote stand for that meeting and then 'down the road' the person is reviewed again?
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">20:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> just curous
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">20:18:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'm in no hurry.. I just like knowing the 'machinery behind the machine' if you know what I mean.
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">20:18:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,    by apply again, are you saying you got a rejection and when you applied again you got that message?
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">20:18:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i guess there is no mechanism to reapply
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">20:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> :-/
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">20:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I was going to go back and reapply as before it was "not enough participation" which was about a year or so ago.. wanted to try an apply again.
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">20:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there've been some bugs in the past that prevented re-application.  If that's the case, we need to know if you are experienceing it.
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">20:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> are you here ?
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">20:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> why not?
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">20:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Well, supposedly you are to be able to login to your user account and 'reapply' but mine just says "already applied" or something
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">20:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Yeah.. I'm experiencing that
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">20:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> half
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">20:19:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> there is. you just have to reject. i know we implemented that
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">20:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> do we have a workflow in users.o.o to reapply ?
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">20:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">20:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> there you go
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">20:19:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> i thought connect.o.o will do it?
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">20:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> whats your username?
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">20:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> will do, once it is ready
<a name="l-580"></a><span class="tm">20:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> yeah openSUSE member current status is now... blank
<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">20:20:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-582"></a><span class="tm">20:20:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> it used to say "application in process" or something
<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">20:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> I wont touch it if we dont get a timeline for the whole connect/users migration
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">20:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> its dominian

<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">20:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> /o\
<a name="l-595"></a><span class="tm">20:21:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> on its way darix
<a name="l-596"></a><span class="tm">20:21:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> no, my next question, i just allow Dominian to ask first
<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">20:21:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> ok
<a name="l-598"></a><span class="tm">20:21:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> what about nvidia?
<a name="l-599"></a><span class="tm">20:21:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> his question is solved ;)
<a name="l-600"></a><span class="tm">20:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> well sort of solved ;)
<a name="l-601"></a><span class="tm">20:22:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'd like to reapply so we are 50/50 solved hehe ;)
<a name="l-602"></a><span class="tm">20:22:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> normally when i delete packages that violate the policy
<a name="l-603"></a><span class="tm">20:22:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> so it's a technical problem
<a name="l-604"></a><span class="tm">20:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> aye
<a name="l-605"></a><span class="tm">20:22:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> i send them a mail and tell them not to do it again
<a name="l-606"></a><span class="tm">20:22:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> we have atleast one user that did ignore the mail and is building the nvidia stuff in the obs again
<a name="l-607"></a><span class="tm">20:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> so what i would like to know ... what to do with such users?
<a name="l-608"></a><span class="tm">20:23:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> block their account
<a name="l-609"></a><span class="tm">20:23:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1  but that's a technical decision  so  moot +  :-)
<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">20:23:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> they can just create a new one and continue?
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">20:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whats the problem? :)
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">20:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> what about second warning with saying we'll block your account
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">20:23:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">_michl:</span> ok
<a name="l-614"></a><span class="tm">20:24:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> yes. what do you want to do. kill him? :)
<a name="l-615"></a><span class="tm">20:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">_michl:</span> that's what we try to settle right now
<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">20:24:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> to have a process or workflow how to deal with these guys
<a name="l-617"></a><span class="tm">20:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> block their account. and the one what ignores this you have to battle on technical grounds anyway
<a name="l-618"></a><span class="tm">20:25:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> i just dont want to decide it on my own?
<a name="l-619"></a><span class="tm">20:25:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> s/what/that/
<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">20:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> why not? :(
<a name="l-621"></a><span class="tm">20:25:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> because it is kinda defining a policy and that something the board/community should do
<a name="l-622"></a><span class="tm">20:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> and
<a name="l-623"></a><span class="tm">20:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> the board should moderate issues?
<a name="l-624"></a><span class="tm">20:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">20:25:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> not really, not according to what was stated earlier in this meeting
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">20:26:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the policy is "don't misuse the OBS"
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">20:26:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is about enforcing it isnt it?
<a name="l-628"></a><span class="tm">20:26:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-629"></a><span class="tm">20:26:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if its clearly written, then darix  you should not be in any awkward role to enforce it.
<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">20:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so i say warn them and if they ignore it and do it again block their account
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">20:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> However, the only concern I would think as to why such people might not be listening is if they can't read the language you wrote it in     But welll... that's just something else
<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">20:27:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> everybody can operate google translate...
<a name="l-633"></a><span class="tm">20:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> you can be sure that you have the full backing of the board to do that
<a name="l-634"></a><span class="tm">20:28:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> right guys?
<a name="l-635"></a><span class="tm">20:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-636"></a><span class="tm">20:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I got your back, darix
<a name="l-637"></a><span class="tm">20:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   but on another sub-topic, I guess related to workflow?.....
<a name="l-638"></a><span class="tm">20:29:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nykkto&gt;</span> An idea to counter the language barrier would be to make a list of common offenses and then make a translated boiler plate for those offenses, or at least a simple one that says you have done something wrong and need to find out what it is before you get in trouble.
<a name="l-639"></a><span class="tm">20:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if such a person continues to flout, and darix or whomever blocks...  shouldn't there be some kind of notice somewhere that this is a person who acts in such a way  and thus if we see the person acting the same way elsewhere in the Project, we know this person has a history and act accordingly?
<a name="l-640"></a><span class="tm">20:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes, you have our backing, but please document the process somewhere
<a name="l-641"></a><span class="tm">20:30:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and write a full explanation as a first warning
<a name="l-642"></a><span class="tm">20:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> (and by full explanation I mean link to the related material ...)
<a name="l-643"></a><span class="tm">20:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we might add some profile field to connect which will be editable (and viewable) only by board
<a name="l-644"></a><span class="tm">20:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> guys...
<a name="l-645"></a><span class="tm">20:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is a simple problem that now after we run the OBS since years pops up the first time
<a name="l-646"></a><span class="tm">20:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how overly complicated can we make this?
<a name="l-647"></a><span class="tm">20:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I didn't see anything overly complicated in what we just said
<a name="l-648"></a><span class="tm">20:34:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you talk about a project wide messaging system that notifies us of darix blocking users....
<a name="l-649"></a><span class="tm">20:35:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i take it you want it also for other tools? ;)
<a name="l-650"></a><span class="tm">20:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> just delete the account and take it from there
<a name="l-651"></a><span class="tm">20:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> all he's gotta do is just let us know that he blocked someone becaus that person repeatedly refused to abidbe by the rules.
<a name="l-652"></a><span class="tm">20:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its hardly complicated.
<a name="l-653"></a><span class="tm">20:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> then please at the end send a notification to board@
