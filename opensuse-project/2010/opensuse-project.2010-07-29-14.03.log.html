<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">14:05:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> cool, but lets let michl quickly report on the status
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">14:05:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> as he was nicely preparing stuff in a spreadsheet
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">14:05:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">14:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> shoot
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">14:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> after some doubts by myself 2 weeks ago paper submission increased dramatically over the last week or so
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">14:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> dramatically!
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">14:06:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so yesterday we passed 25 submissions
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">14:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> out of different areas
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">14:07:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> upstream, community, other distros etc.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">14:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that means we'll have 25 presentations?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">14:07:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes, if we accept all
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">14:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and just had lars in my room who is participating in openSUSE Education
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">14:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> they want to do 4 presentations plus a workshop on that
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">14:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and there are more in the pipeline, but not yet arrived
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">14:08:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> you know, there are about 30 hours time left
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">14:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> on your sheet I miss some talks
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">14:08:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Hmm... I thought we were hoping to not do so much presentations and do more focus on talks for this Conference?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">14:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and dragotin, myself and maybe some other approached some prospects directly
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">14:08:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so I guess there is more to come
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">14:09:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> sure, that does not mean that we accept all
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">14:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> or that we can not convince people to change the format if we want that
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">14:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  just wondered
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">14:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> what do you miss ?=

<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">14:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hurry to send it as after tomorrow michl will be lazy on his ass for 2 weeks  :-))
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">14:12:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> /ignore suseROCKs
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">14:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> that's one reason why we should talk about the upcoming 2 weeks

<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">14:13:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> you said that ;-)
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">14:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> sorry
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">14:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> that mean we need to decide on proposals and best group them already to get a draft program
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">14:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> means we have around 1,5 weeks after you arrive
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">14:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> ts, ts, you've been better in counting

<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">14:15:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok, seems we have to work even without you
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">14:16:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> Doofi
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">14:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> wie gehts cornelius :)
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">14:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cornelius&gt;</span> hi, sorry for being late
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">14:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> we can do it!
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">14:16:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> where did michl  say he didn't trust anyone?   He's merely talking about his absence and what he will be unable to fulfill during his absence
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">14:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I'd like to find a finished program when I return :-)
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">14:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> ok
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">14:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cornelius&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> I'm fine, thanks :-)
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">14:17:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> suseROCKs,  How are you?  I'm fine!  thanks for asking!
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">14:17:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I don't see a problem sorting and arranging the proposals we have now
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">14:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> harder is what we do not have now
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">14:17:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> we still have stuff to work on with key notes
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">14:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dragotin:</span> yes, key note is an issue
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">14:18:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> with the unconferencing about which we talked in the first conference meeting I think
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">14:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> as frankly - at least myself - haven't done anything on that
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">14:18:31 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">has a suggestion for keynoter but will wait til the proper moment</span>
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">14:18:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> well Jos could/should do the opening keynote
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">14:18:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> for unconferencing I think the program committee should give some directions/headlines
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">14:19:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> didn't you volunteer that time to care about unconferencing?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">14:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> but don't wait too long, key noters need to arrange there schedule in advance
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">14:19:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I might be wrong with that...
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">14:19:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> personally i dont want to see the conference go down the brainshare style route
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">14:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> what does that mean
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">14:19:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">14:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  ummm   Don't think so.  I've kept largely on the sidelines for this conference committee with mostly just giving input wherever it is unwarranted  :-)
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">14:20:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> dragotin, what i mean is being a suit style conference
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">14:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ok, sorry
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">14:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> this fear is not needed here
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">14:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> Oh, don't worry ;-)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">14:20:44 </span><span class="nka">* dragotin</span> <span class="ac">won't wear a suit</span>
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">14:20:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> only cornelius, he usually does so ;-)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">14:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> i'll pay to see you wear one ;)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">14:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but FunkyPenguin a skirt perhapbs
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">14:21:21 </span><span class="nka">* FunkyPenguin</span> <span class="ac">remembers seeing localhorst in a suit - that was weird</span>
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">14:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but back to keynoters, we should find some AIs how we go on on this
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">14:21:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> let's get back to to do's for the next 2-3 weeks
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">14:21:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> well what do we want from a keynote?
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">14:21:55 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">sees FunkyPenguin sitting at the end of the stage with dollars in fist paying someone to undress/or dress in a suit</span>
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">14:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> talks should be selectedn and grouped
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">14:22:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> publicity
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">14:22:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so can I give a suggestion for a possible keynoter now?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">14:22:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> gnokii_, ok so publicity for what?
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">14:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we're eager to hear
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">14:22:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> you mean get someone like linus or bruce?
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">14:22:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> Fun, some inspiration, and/or a "side"-topic which has surprising parallels to FOSS
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">14:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't know what names you have already discussed previously, but I was at Community Leadership Summit and was asked to look for possible candidates there.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">14:22:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">FunkyPenguin:</span> u asked what we want from a keynote speaker
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">14:23:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> gnokii_, thats fine, but a little more clarification is need ;)
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">14:23:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Only one person jumped out and I really found him personable and great to talk to .   Gervase Markham from Mozilla Foundation.  And particularly because of his job role   His title is Grease Gun
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">14:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I think this would be a good choice, we should ask him
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">14:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Gerv could be fun
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">14:24:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'll assume you have his contact info already, but if not, ask as I have his card.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">14:24:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but I am hesitant to discuss names in public here

<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">14:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> ok?
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">14:25:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maybe out of the submissions additional topics or speakers to approach arise

<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">14:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> I already thougth about that
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">14:30:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ademmer:</span> are you around ?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">14:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  We, on the marketing team, are debating having a Marketing Hackfest the day before the Conference starts.   I'm wondering if we should also see if other teams wish to have a day-long hackfest and try to organize location for several hackfests to occur simultaneously
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">14:30:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ademmer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> yes
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">14:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> cool, but why a day before?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">14:30:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> guys, on topic please
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">14:30:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I would vote to have one day during the conf reserved for this kind of activities
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">14:30:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and the topic is openSUSE conference web presence
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">14:31:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> ACK
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">14:31:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ademmer:</span> just wanted to invite you as we're on openSUSE conference web presence
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">14:31:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> well we could, and *should* use retro
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">14:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  because during a hackfest you're supposed to spend all your time focused on the hackfest.    Esp for Marketing team, that would be distracting when we're supposed to be roaming around and seeing what everyone else is doing
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">14:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and I heard you may have knowledge with such stuff ;-)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">14:32:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ademmer&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">14:32:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a hackfest during a conference is pretty much guaranteed to not have many show up
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">14:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maybe someone out of the marketing team, rlihm and ademmer might work together to make openSUSE Conference a competitive and attractive web presence

<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">14:44:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> arent we supposed to be using retro so we can all see the progress of things etc
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">14:45:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> as a pm tool we arent exactly using it well to manage this pretty big and crucial project
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">14:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">14:46:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but I am unsure if Retro is good for that
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">14:47:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> well we need something that can easily be used to show status of AIs show timelines etc
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">14:47:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> we need to be able to pencil in rough dates, and see how they fit in

<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">14:49:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;FunkyPenguin&gt;</span> michl, well if we had a rough timeline for milestones etc available to view people would be able to discuss issues better - just my thoughts
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">14:50:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I am fine with trying Retro for that if somebody volunteers to help tracking data there
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">14:51:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> maybe some old school stuff like we did for the 11.3 launch (which was crucial btw as well) would fullfill the task

<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:00:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> or unplanned sessions, rather
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:00:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> nothing in stone yet
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:00:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I'll probably have a talk to do about the new package search, but as it's not finished yet...
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> I would vote for quite some time
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:00:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and I would vote for quite some outline or topics in advance
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so people know roughly what will happen or to which topic
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:01:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we can anyway add stuff adhoc
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">15:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> yeah, I rather meant ad-hoc
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">15:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> like, if I come with a talk proposal in 3 weeks ... :)
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">15:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but my experience last year were the unconference part filled up very slowly and peopel then didn't know about interesting stuff for them
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">15:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> yes and no
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">15:02:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so something in between would be perfect, space for adhoc and some topics, headlines in advance
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">15:02:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> my experience with the planned talks is that most of them were utterly boring and not really useful compared to the unplanned discussion sessions we had (but maybe that's just me)
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">15:02:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> we're in agreeement - I guess
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">15:02:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> point is, the "unconf" part can certainly be better.. err.. organized :D
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">15:02:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we need both
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">15:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> aye
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">15:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well anyway, I think we're all flexible enough to accomodate
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">15:03:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but ball taken, the unconf need some attention
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">15:03:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> just announcing *where* we have a grid with last-minute talks would help and probably solve most issues
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">15:04:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> or, rather, that we have one at all
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">15:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> maybe also define one person as being in charge of managing the rooms and schedule, even for ad-hoc things
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">15:04:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> "you want to do a talk this afternoon ‚Üí go talk to ..."
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">15:04:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> right
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">15:05:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I agree with yaloki's format.   We had the same format at Community Leadership Summit and it worked out reaaally realllly well
