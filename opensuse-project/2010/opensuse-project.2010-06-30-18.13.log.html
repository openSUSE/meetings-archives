<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> right, that's really confusing
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> You need to type it - you're the master!

<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> me the master ? huh
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Strategy discussion</span>
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:17:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so, we have a few tons of discussions going on
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:17:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Does everyone feel we're going in the right direction with the way we're presenting strategy proposals?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:18:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> not sure we do
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but at least we have a lot of discussions, which is always good
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:18:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes Community is definitely alive!
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:18:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> from the feedback I had so far, it's quite confusing
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> a lot of people are frightened by it, because the proposals narrow it down too much (or, at least, how they understand it)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but there are a few other proposals, some of which could be merged
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> e.g. "poweruser" and "developer", because it's mostly the same direction
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> nevertheless, I'm not sure we already got the discussion rolling properly
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> any other impressions/opinions ?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:20:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> the last one from jengelh which goes into that direction is great too imho
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   which one?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ah, sorry, I have quite some email backlog :\
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:21:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> no wonder :-(
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> "Strategy d: Status Quo, and quantified so"
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:21:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I did manage to keep up with it for a few days though :)
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> well, lulz
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ahh I saw that come up but didn't read it yet
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> imho that should be merged with the developer and power user one and then it is great
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> why?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   yes,  its the kind of threads sadly where if you blink you lose track of the thread.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:22:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> sorry, I should read the whole proposal, I was just reacting to the title ¬¬
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:22:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we definetely have some overlaps and need to summarize and merge probably
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:22:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and wording is quite important
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:22:39 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">needs to take care of his daughter, will be back later...</span>
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:23:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> of utmost importance, even
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> even if 5 people check it, it might ignite a bomb - like the forum discussion
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Folks, just so you know...  the Strategy Team has an AI currently to sort through all the threads and try to give some semblance of coherence for everyone
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We should see some nice summarizations in the near future for everyone so we can all re-review in a compatible manner
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:24:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> ok, then let's just say that, right now, we don't have enough contributors to continue as we did
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> and in order to e.g. uphold the quality of factory and the distro, we need to narrow our focus
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> of course, everyone would wish to continue doing everything
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:25:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but isn't that just wishful thinking ?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:25:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes and no
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> And do more  and more each year like in the past
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> defining an utopic strategy is one thing, next question is: how do we do it
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:25:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> so drop some less important / used stuff from factory and make it community maintained. but imho narrowing down the whole distro "target" is the wrong way.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:26:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> I'm didn't necessarily mean the distro
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:26:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> We're speaking about a community strategy!
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:26:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> narrowing down from the whole spectrum
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're not necessarily "narrowing down"   i think that's a misnomer.  We're narrowing our general focus, but at the same time, if there are individuals who prefer to continue some smaller priority on their own, we won't stop them.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> indeed
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:26:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it isn't about forbidding anything
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:26:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> err
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:27:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it isn't about forbidding something :)
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:27:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> whatever :)
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:27:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's a matter of priorities
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:27:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> sure, I think no one thought that :)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:27:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> I think quite a few thought that
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   do you think we need to re-emphasize that?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> dunno, I never understood it as "forbidding" anything so I wouldn't think it should be emphasized - yaloki might disagree there then. What disturbed me is that some of the proposals are just narrowing the topic down too much.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> which is why I like the developer / power user / jengelh's ones
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:29:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then that's the one you endorse.  :-)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:29:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> well, the interesting question will be _how_
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> I think it's important to not only read the focus but also the rest of the statement
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:30:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> by slimming down factory from seldom used stuff so the current resources suffice to maintain factory in a proper way
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> we cannot be excellent in everything - so let's decide where we want to be excellent
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:30:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> strategy proposal: openSUSE greatest distro for server, workstation, lots of desktops, mobile, developers, end users.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:30:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ok, how?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> not sure that would be sufficient
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:31:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> sure, I think I did that. But I simply can't think of some narrowed down goal I would subscribe to.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:31:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but, of course, there's another POV
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:31:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> maybe, just maybe, it would be sufficient to concentrate on increasing the number of contributors
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:31:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and then maybe our current "strategy" would be realistic
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:32:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but if our goal is to increase the number of contributors, then our "strategy" would be ways to attract the contributors.  i.e., more tools
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:32:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> we have been assuming that we cannot keep on doing "everything but the kitchen sink"
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:32:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> maybe that assumption is wrong
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:32:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> more than that, we are in something of a bind now where we don't have enough contributors stepping up to roles and tasks.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but, for sure, contributors are quite scarce in several domains as of now
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yeah, but there are several potential reasons to that
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Thus we face the problem of one man holding a ship and if that person goes away for some reason, that priorty becomes neglected
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> lack of interest is what we've been assuming, but maybe the problem is that it's too difficult/hidden to get aboard
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:33:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> again, we always have to keep in mind that during our strategy process, we have made certain assumptions
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> never, ever forget that
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> like I said, if contributor growth is our strategy, then the activity would be to ensure quality and access to the tools to attract them
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:34:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> if those assumptions are wrong, the proposals are potentially wrong too
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:34:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> s/potentially/probably/
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:35:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> what we currently don't have is a sort of assessment of where we have enough contributors, and where we're lacking
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's not forget one important thing...
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:35:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Last year when we brought up that we need to address this, I said we were "soul searching".... At this point, we've expanded the number of soul searchers
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:35:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> as an example, the fact that coolo needs more people to help maintaining factory totally went under the radar IMHO
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:35:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And that will always add more assumptions/oversights we didn't see before.  I think that part is quite normal
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:36:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well, I meant that "just" doing "operational optimizations" would be enough, without an earthquake of a strategy
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:36:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it is certainly an option worth discussing
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> e.g. through jengelh's proposal
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,  well, in light of recent discussions, I'm also beginning to wonder if strategy proposals might be premature right now, and infrastructure optimization as you put it should be dealt with in the short-term
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> at some point, and before the votes, we will have to discuss the feasibility of each proposal
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:37:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we still have to have an end-goal somehow of what those optimizations will enhance
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:37:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> mmh, part of the discussion is also being ready for the future.  would we achieve that?
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:37:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> that is one potential strategy
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:37:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Hence the "what would these optimizations enhance"  :-)
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:38:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> being a nice place for contributors to do what they like to do is an equally important goal, never mind what comes in the future
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:38:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> e.g. not give a damn about the mobile/cloud/roaming thing, because most (if not all) the current contributors don't care about it
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:39:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (just an example :))
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">18:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> :-)
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">18:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I would personally prefer to step back a bit from the process
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">18:39:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and think about what's important to us

<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">18:40:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> e.g. a friendly place with great tools for contributors
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">18:40:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> without having to press it into the "strategy template"
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:40:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't think they're mutually exclusive, yaloki.  But I do see some value in at least addressing some of the immediate fixable issues first
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:41:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because people are too focused on those issues rather than big picture.  And for big picture to succeed, we need people's focus and support
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:41:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> maybe the distro should be added to this friendly place
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:41:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> personally, I wouldn't mind having "define a strategy later, just define some major focus points now, and work on short-term first"
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:41:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> oh, I was assuming that :D
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> agreed
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:42:16 </span><span class="nka">* yaloki</span> <span class="ac">puts his daughter to bed, brb</span>
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:42:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> by defining what's important to us we need to define the "us" as well
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so here's a question to ponder:
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we had this user, developer discussion
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:43:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If we feel we should address "immediately-fixable" issues, what time frame can we expect to raise/address/resolve issues and get back on track with strategy?
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:43:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> depends on the number and quality of issues ;-)
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:44:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well I think we had a number of issues appear in the threads
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:44:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we could look at the total sum of "off-topics" when we summarize soon and see how much of it is addressable?
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> right and there are some easier to fix then others
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:44:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and some have something to do with culture which won't change that fast
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:45:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so a higher question is:  Is this what we want to do?  Do we *need* to get strategy proposed and approved in short term future?  Or can we afford to let it wait?
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, what I hear is basically a proposal to say: Let's implement the "Community Statement" from the strategy proposal for now.  Correct?
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> if the community says, it can wait, it can wait
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:46:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   That actually makes sense.  Yeah.
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:46:42 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">does not like throwing everything away - we have achieved a lot!</span>
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:46:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> though we nedd to clean up the statement as you and I have been working on in the last few days
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> the current discussion is already a good one as it brought up some of the important topics we haven't have on the radar anymore
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:47:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   I wouldn't want to throw it away either.  And I'm not proposing that nor is anyone else, I think.  I think what we're doing is realizing there's another step in front of what we have done that needs some nurturing.
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:49:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Please explain again what you mean with the "another step in front"
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:49:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so next step anyway is the summary in general and the "off topic" things
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:49:24 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">couldn't follow the thread completely due to bringing his daughter to bed</span>
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:49:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> always those excuses
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:50:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the next step is as michl just stated.   Basically identify some of the off-topic stuff that is distracting everyone from focusing on the big picture (strategy) and see if we can knock those issues out of the way.
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:50:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> And then concentrate o nthese for the next 12 months ????
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:51:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> noooo
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:51:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 11.5 months!
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:51:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> AJaeger no, for the next 12 years
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:51:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> That I can sign up to ;)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:51:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> actually, I don't think we need to agree to all this today.  We need to look at the total list (like michl said few posts ago) and see what is "addressable"
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;garloff&gt;</span> I don't see implementing the operational improvements that have been identified as a prerequisite to defining a strategy ...
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:52:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> as we don't have a summary yet nor the qualification of the major distractions we can't say we do this first and then the strategy
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:52:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> garloff,   but operational improvements is what is distracting the general community in discussing, approving and actually buying into the strategy, no?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:53:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;garloff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> hmmm, to a point that we can't fix it by trying to strucutre the discussions a bit?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:54:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well, let's see what the summarization looks like first
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're all jumping the gun a bit here I think.  myself included.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:54:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> what "operational improvements" do you mean? E.g. I think OBS does a mighty fine job in allowing contributions for packages.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:54:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> garloff,   before you logged in, there was some discussion by otheres in here that people felt some things fell off the radar that should have been considered as part of our proosals
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:54:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">garloff:</span> To me it looks like the board discuss alternatives - but there's no decision yet.
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:55:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> absolutely no decision yet.   We can't jump the gun
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:56:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   operational improvements can be anything from techincal (OBS) to commuication (Forums) etc.   I'm going to pull back now on any presumptions until I see a good concise summarization of what's been discussed to date.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:58:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;garloff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> If we have indeed missed important aspects, then let's use the good feedback and improve our proposals
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:59:33 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">will try t ospend the whole day tomorrow on summarizing - there was so much discussed...</span>
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:59:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> "operational improvements" means: do what we do, and try to improve that
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:00:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;garloff&gt;</span> do it more efficiently / intelligently
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:01:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I think we need to clarify again that those strategy proposals are *proposals*
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:01:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so at this point, no need to really discuss further until we get a reasonable summarization
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:01:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so again, next step is the summary and the listing of the off topic items
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:01:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and AJ,  don't burn yourself out by reading all those threads in one day if it harms you.  :-)
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:01:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> right

<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">19:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> alrighty, so the remaining outstanding issue in the topic of Membership is the name itself
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">19:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and "Membership" is confusing for many people because "membership" means different things to different projects and thus there's no uniform understanding of the word itself
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">19:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> so be it
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">19:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and secondary, there's confusion because people want to join membership to support openSUSE, only our membership actually is something rewarded *after* you have supported openSUSE
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">19:17:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> lets rename it to "potato", that's much less confusing ;P
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">19:17:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> we won't change this perception
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">19:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   there are many kinds of potatoes.  Can you narrow down a bit please?
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">19:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> great idea, I fully support that one
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">19:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> potatoes is just fine and self explaining
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">19:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And its a very german thing too.  Potatoes everywhere.  :-)
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">19:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saigkill&gt;</span> I've seen in the Membership Applications that some not understand was a Member is. Some of that giving an appliance because they want anything to do.
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">19:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;javier_&gt;</span> who wants to be a potato? ;D
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">19:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the hard cooking ones since we've been told to be quite dense
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">19:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">saigkill:</span> right
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">19:19:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so is the membership naming a real issue or just somehting some people don't get right?
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">19:19:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   LOL
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">19:19:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;saigkill&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">19:19:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> at least to me its more the latter one
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">19:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> some more explanation may help
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">19:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   I think its a naming issue.   Membership defines a way of support to many in perception, myself included.   And our membership is much more of a reward than a membership
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">19:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> take for example... a strange analogy but an example
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">19:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but does it hinder us in anyway?
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">19:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> yes, I think it does
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">19:21:28 </span><span class="nka">* michl</span> <span class="ac">don't</span>
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">19:21:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> You join an airline's mileage program.  (You become a member)   and after you ahve accrued many miles you become a member of the Captain's Club (reward)
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">19:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> given the misunderstandings there are, a lot don't apply for it, and see it as an exclusion/elite thing
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">19:21:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes it does michl    Because we want to encourage people to support us even if they aren't directly contributing
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">19:21:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It's what leads to growth of openSUSE mindshare
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">19:21:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ok, let's just call it "openSUSE captains" :P
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">19:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> just add some "You don't have to be a member to contribute but can become one by contributing" thingy to http://en.opensuse.org/Members and it should be clear enough if one can be bothered to read?

<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">19:22:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">19:22:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> okay, then let's change it into openSUSE potatoe captain
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">19:22:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">19:22:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And where can someone be able to say "I support openSUSE"?
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">19:23:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I cringed every time we turned away a non-sufficient contributing membership application, because the fact is... they applied in first place because they truly supported openSUSE.
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">19:23:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I hated referring to them as spammers in that context
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">19:23:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> The member naming is there since we introduced it - there was always opposition but no superior solution.

<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">19:24:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> of course :D
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">19:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bitshuffler,   that's actually not a ridiculous idea.    Accruing points somehow  makes people want to do more sometimes.

<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">19:25:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> But then we need to count those via scripts.  For each package fix +1 point, for each forums post +2 ;)
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">19:25:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> nah, might work for forums and posts (imho it already sucks there) but it just open an endless can of worms with "Why does X have more potato level than me? I do much more $insert_important_stuff_here!"
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">19:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> something like that.  :-)   Obviously we would have to come up with a formula, and it won't be easy.  But I think it might be a fun way to be a member
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">19:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah, that's not the point
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">19:26:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ok, the discussion is really going low now, we've raised interest from microchip_ ;DDD

<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">19:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, dunno, but right now, I think almost any term would be better than member
