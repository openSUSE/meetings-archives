<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:07:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Right now  I see 4 goals.
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> First, The top goal is as a Board to get the Foundation up and operational.  As we continue to work towards this, I'm sure that we will uncover other issues that we will need to address.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:07:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Second:</span> Grow the Community
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:08:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Third:</span>  Is a personal goal: Tune up my decoder ring for all these alias cloaking and get to know as many people as possible -simply because that is the fun part of being in a community.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> LOL, some have more than one alias

<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:10:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I gone through a few days.  Figured AlanClark was good for now
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:10:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'd like to mention that if you'd like to meet AlanClark in person, there's a good chance of meeting him in Los Angeles when he joins the hip openSUSE Ambassador Crew showcasing openSUSE at SCALE  February 25-27
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:10:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I will be there with suseROCKs

<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nothing else? then lets continue with the agenda :)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:12:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> foot steps as in experience?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Siju&gt;</span> another question: can/will AlanClark fullfill michl positions?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;coolo&gt;</span> yes, I tried to be colourful :)
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:13:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Siju:</span> please define positions
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I and my team created one of the first open source projects within Novell - several years ago.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> coolo, AlanClark is one of the OSRB members in Novell, the commitee which focuses on licensing and copyrights, usage of open-source software in Novell applications.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:14:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Siju&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> boardpositions ... talking with novell
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Siju&gt;</span> ah, okey
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:15:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> More recently worked with other open source projects outside Novell.  Some were successful some not - for example Eclipse Aperi project
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Siju,   by filling the chairperson role, by definition, he is a communicator to Novell, along with the rest of us.
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Siju&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> fine :)
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> what means "to Novell" here?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:16:24 </span><span class="nka">* dragotin</span> <span class="ac">feels Novell as well</span>
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so, I doubt that is a good explanation
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> AlanClark after the meeting I have some question about  licensing and copyrights if you have some time
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:16:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> sure I have time
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  depends on the nature of the communication.   But in general, it would be Markus Rex
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:17:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:17:22 </span><span class="nka">* dragotin</span> <span class="ac">very often talks to Markus Rex as well :o)</span>
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,   Hence the "us"  :-)
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:17:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> and I think many of us could
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:17:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Us as in community
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, what my point is is that most Novell'is are simply community
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> point taken
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> A lot of text flew by;  Did I hit the high points of the questions?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think so yes
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:19:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> lets get going with the agenda. we have an additional topic today
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:19:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think so as well

<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I have a statement I'd like to enter into the record on this topic, if I may?
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there are a couple of things we need to discuss i think
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes sure. go ahead
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Do we have to say #info for on the record or just type away?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:21:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> whatever you like
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:22:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I welcome Novell's support for the creation of a Foundation with its selection of Alan Clark to sit on the Board and help us steer the course.   I would like to take a moment to remind us all that this is a partnership endeavor between the Community and Novell. While, in the past, we have entertained the possibility of going it alone, I am excited to see that Novell agrees with us that a partnership is the way to go and we look forwa
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:22:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> rd to Novell's continued participation in our endeavors as we proceed in a transparent and open process.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:22:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (end)
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:23:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think we all look forward to that
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> great point
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:24:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> now the last part is what i wanted to talk about first
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> transparent and open process that is
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think we have a disconnect there and need to close this
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:25:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> talk in one forum where everybody that needs to be involved is involved
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:25:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and i would like to have this in the open
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:25:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> because frankly, the foundation will only work if we find enough people willing to make it work
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1000
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:26:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and i fear that we have lost the way a bit there
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and to find enough people, we need to make the people feel that they have a vested interest
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:26:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well not only that if I may
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:26:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:27:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> so what you are proposing is to start an open mailing list e.g. foundation@opensuse.org or ... ?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we need to make people feel comfortable and that everything they shall do is for the common good
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:28:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes. one small part would be to broaden the audience
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so henne I understand your point, but let me raise a couple points they may be exceptions.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> for example
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> many people just want someone to show the the way
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> many people just want someone to show them the way
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:28:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> open is only a thing where the people can decide!
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:29:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> part of the work here will be with attorney's who charge by the hour.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:29:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> to minimize our $$ spent.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:29:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> +1 on suseROCKs statement
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:30:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> sorry, can you rephrase that, at least me can not really understand what that means
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I propose that we prep materials and that a subset will present the materials to them - most likely not through a mailing list
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:30:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok guys, lets let AlanClark finish his statement before we proceed with our comments
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:30:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> sounds good to me :)
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:31:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> tigerfoot :-)
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> can you maybe outline a bit what going to the lawyers would involve?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:31:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> my point being that there are cases where we are going to have to have a subset of people work through some topics and conversations
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:31:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this sounds so scary for people who don't do this often...
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:31:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> doesn't mean that we don't communicate
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:32:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> or report
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:32:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> just means that we have to optimize people, time and $$
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:32:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> exactly, having a subset of people working on something is not excluding openness
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:32:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> nope. no one thinks that...
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">19:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> alright
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">19:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> of course it doesn't
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">19:33:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> with all due respect,  I don't think its the legal communication we're as concerned with, but rather that there is transparency in the conduit between all partners on this initiative.
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">19:33:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and I'm concerened with the amount of people who i seen willing to carry the foundation once it exists
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">19:33:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i mean the usual workflow is this:
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:34:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 1. some people find out that they want to do something together in some form of a NFP
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the lawyers aren't partners.  They're just simply doing what they're paid to do.   But within our own initiative, we should ensure that all partners are open and communicative in a way that we all know up front what is happening.
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:34:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> do you mean from the community in gerenal, the ambassador, what group?
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> everybody
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 2. they hash out bylaws
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:35:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> henne really everybody, or just opensuse member first ( so we keep control on it at the first time ? )
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:35:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> henne you are talikng about support,right?
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> guys,  let henne finish his list  :-)
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:36:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:36:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 3. they have an inauguration meeting
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:36:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and the same people afterwards do the work
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:37:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think we slipped into 2. without bringing in all people that we need to support the foundation
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> people that afterwards fill the foundation with life
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:37:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Actually, I think there's a subset to 1 that has occured which slipped into 2
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:38:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> a.k.a. doing the work
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:38:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes. a bit too far for my taste
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:38:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what kind of works will be needed?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:38:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> except what we are already do?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:38:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> thats something we need to find out in phase 2.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;BManojlovic&gt;</span> how we can help
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:39:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> you have a good point.  I agree that we slipped into 2, which is a point that I have on list to raise
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:39:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> In 1.a.  (so to speak)  People who have been doing some work didn't communicate with others, and others took the ball without the rest of us knowing and in the end a chaotic and disconnected process that no longer felt like a board initiative
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:39:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yeah that too. but thats spilled milk i think...
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:39:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well the trouth is that we live in some chaos
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure, but we'd like to not spill milk again henceforth.  :-)
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I am willing to jump in to help out.
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> what are you experiences with this? how did this work out for the OSDL for instance?
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> henne OSDL?
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so if I'm understanding henne  I think that we need to spin a discussion on what I would call a "governance model" discussion
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:41:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so let's take this 1a. turn into an action item to have a longer discussion.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:41:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> and walk through this.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:42:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> use the force (google) ;)
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:42:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> warlordfff, opensourcedevelopmentlabs (alan's earlier venture)
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:42:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> you mean now?
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> sooory
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I believe that discussion will help close the issue and make sure we've got everybody involved
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:43:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> that sounds like we should discuss what the functions of the foundation will be
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:43:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> not now.  Create a separate thread or IRC meeting
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> as I think governance is a topic for the community as a whole, not neccessarily bound to the foundation
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:44:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> for the community as a whole?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:44:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well isn't the forming of the foundation the next step for the community?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:44:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> But the foundation effects the community and hennes point is that we need all the relevant stake holders to be part of the communication
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> thats true
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:45:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's be careful not to distract from the very specific point of this discussion which is to ensure that the process of creating the foundation is in fact open and transparent.   Broader issues of governance should most certainly be discussed, but in a different context from this one.
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:45:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> right, sorry for disturbing
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:46:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so who are the relevant stake holders?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:46:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> how do we identify that?
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   That is the current step.  :-)    The issue is how to be aware of who is doing what and why and that we all can speak our support/concerns easily.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:46:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> not to start a fight, but you do me true open and transparent, not the current white house calls open transparent
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:47:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:47:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> suseROCKs we are at the same page
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I think we all got the point now.   And I think we should address the question of henne's....  "Who are the stake holders"
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:47:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> as always: pick people who are interested, willing to do work and maybe have experience already

<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:48:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Stakeholders are those who have an interest and or will be effect by this.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:48:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the people
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">19:49:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> AlanClark what kind of interest?

<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">19:49:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> If the board controls the funds - those who want $$
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:49:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> If hte board controls the trademark - those who want to use the trademark
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:50:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And if Novell doesn't plan to give the trademark ownership outright, then --- Those who own the trademark   :-)
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:50:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what about those who haven't any of those interests?
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:51:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> your question is off base
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:51:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but care and are willing to work and be a part of it?
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   that depends on what the community considers the role of the foundation to be.  At this point in time, funding and trademark are definite roles we wish to exercise.   Other roles are not so clear yet and the community needs to speak up what it wants the Foundation to do.  Ex.  community governance
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:52:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> these are all good questions and points.  My recommendation is that we setup a date/time outside of this meeting, so that we can get on with the agenda, to work this.
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:52:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok,I agree
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:53:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> well. we also want to transfer all the "interests" the current board has to the foundation
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> okay but that leaves the question where
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:53:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and with whom
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> Is there a separate, periodic private meeting for the board members ?
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">19:53:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> henne +1
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so give the action item to set the discussion and to return to the board with a result
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:54:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> no
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:54:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> henne, hmm okay. thanks.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:54:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> typo - so give me the ...
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:54:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> open meetings here in the channel along with a foundation mailing list?  or use existing mailing list (e.g. -project ML?)
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:54:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> typo - so give me the action item to setup the discussion and return to the next board meeting iwth a result
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyway you decide to make it ,it has to be PUBLIC
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">19:55:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> right we do it this channel
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">19:55:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> hm
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">19:55:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> what would be a result to come back with?
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">19:55:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> a list of people interested?
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">19:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> project m-l  is prone to too much of noise. I ebleive the board members are enough representatives for the community. so involving them alone is sufficient (imho :) ) and the results can be announced in project instead of discussing in public
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">19:56:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> or a different channel - we just need to publish the where / when
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">19:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> that is exactly what we are trying to get out of
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">19:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> dragotin a list of people interested is not enough I believe
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">19:56:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> because the board isnt the only stakeholder
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">19:56:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> henne, hm okay
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">19:56:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> psankar,   avoiding project may be good, especially as the discussions grow more technical.  But keeping it within the board isn't helpful.  That prevents transparency.   Especially when there will be more than just the board involved
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">19:56:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> thats why I am asking
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">19:57:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> psankar I dissagre with that
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">19:57:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> suseROCKs, okay
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">19:57:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> warlordfff, :)
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">19:57:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> why not set up a -foundation ml and invite all people interested in the discussion there?
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">19:58:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we'll certainly be very involved, and hopefully you trust our leadership as we shape the direction of discussion and implementation.
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">19:58:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> dragotin +1000
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">19:58:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah i think ml is better then IRC
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">19:58:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> sure, it is
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">19:58:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its archived, none-realtime, easier to deal with

<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">19:59:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yes I believe a ML is a great idea

<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">19:59:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> there needs to be a good moderation, ie. summarizing regularly, asking people for discussion discipline and such

<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">20:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> good idea

<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">20:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I fear we're still not addressing the real issues of transparency breakdown
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">20:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I like the idea of posting updates and results to a wiki page

<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">20:01:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> why would it be write protected?
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">20:01:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure we have a wiki page, and mailing list that's archived and all that jazz and its just great.    But the problem we've had is when we hand off a task and we don't know what's going on after that.  For a loooong time.
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">20:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you can trace any change to a wiki page...
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">20:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so that someone writes the conclutions
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">20:01:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> this is where the transparency broke.
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">20:02:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> we might also need to actively invite people to the list, as some of experienced people already have given up on that topic
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">20:02:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you mean in the past?
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">20:02:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> because I can watch th discussion on the ML or on the Wiki if u open it u have to watch both
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">20:02:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> so we should kind of relaunch the discussion (carefully ;-)
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">20:02:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> correct henne   and what we're proposing now doesn't alleviate what happened from not happening again

<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">20:03:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can you maybe elaborate on that a bit?
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">20:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> which handed off tasks are you talking about?
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">20:03:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> talking to "novell"?
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">20:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as we are saying now that we are all partners in this, all partners (or stake holders) should be actively part of the communication.     No more closed door stuff
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">20:03:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   yes
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">20:04:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">20:04:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes i have to agree. this whole thing needs to happen from now on on whatever medium we decide here today
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">20:04:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and nowhere else
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">20:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">20:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but i don't think anyone is in disagreement about that...
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">20:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> right?
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">20:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> correct
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">20:05:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> alan raises his hand
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">20:05:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't either.   My point is not whether we agree on that.  but whether the mehanisms we are proposing today will ensure that
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">20:06:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm typing a long note
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">20:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> is that an aye or a nay? ;)
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">20:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> it's a we need to clarify...
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">20:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">20:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> please go ahead
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">20:08:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm not sure what is being referred to with "closed door stuff".  But let me make a clear point.  I agree that the communication from the stake holders should in the open and clear.  Novell is a stakeholder for example.  Inside Novell there are many voices.  There will be many different discussion,arguments, etc. inside Novell.
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">20:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> still typing...
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">20:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> What the community needs to see is not those voices but a clear statement from the stakeholder.
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">20:11:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlanClark:</span> and the problem is that this has not worked very good so far
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">20:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Well I am personally more concerned about the community part
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">20:11:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> thats why people here bring it up
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">20:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> yes, the statements from the Novell stakeholder are one part
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">20:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> Which why I raise, and Markus has asked me to help make sure that Novell is speaking with a open clear voice
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">20:11:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but there is more: as the foundation is there to support the community
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">20:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> there is a lot to discuss/decide within the community
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">20:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think here's where we need to identify.   Clear statements from any stakeholder is important, indeed.  But we also want us all involved together in the thought process, because in the end, that is what will build true consensus.  Rather than political jockeying or what-have-you
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">20:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKS:</span> Alan agrees
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">20:12:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> dragotin and vice versa
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">20:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok here's a proposal from me...
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">20:14:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we've all stated our case here, and really in a nutshell, we all pretty much seem to agree on the same points.    We're just wondering how to get from here to there.   Let's just take a step back and let our minds work and at the next meeting, we'll have a definite answer to it all.
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">20:14:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> uhm to what all?
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">20:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> you've lost me
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">20:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I don't think a meeting is enough
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">20:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I am lost too a bit
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">20:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlanClark expresses his desire to also keep the process open.   He also has to ensure that the statements from his stakeholder (Novell) is clear.   Those two don't always mesh that well easily
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">20:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I also think that part of the point here is that we, as a board, are going to have to proactively seek out community members input and thoughts
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">20:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> give him a chance to mull it over and come up with a solution for his interested party
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">20:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> so.. because this... In my opinion we need to have wikipage and ML working asap
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">20:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro +1000 already ;-)
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">20:16:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay so what, except waiting for the next meeting, are we going to do now?
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">20:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> open presents  :-)
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">20:17:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wikipage and ML as we already said?
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">20:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and agreed
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">20:17:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ????
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">20:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> the community should get their needs/concerns documented in bullets, after discussioin in the mailling list ?
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">20:17:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> good to do now or open to volunters to make sure some was done before next meeting
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">20:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's easy enough to do
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">20:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> but the questions and issues need to be broken down into directed topics
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">20:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">20:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">20:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> so henne let me propose this:
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">20:18:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so we need to organize.
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">20:18:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> henne +1
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">20:19:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> let me start some on the wiki page.
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">20:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 2. We have the board review it, briefly
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">20:20:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 3. We then send out a post to the relevant stake holders, etc.  with directed questions (generated from the #2)
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">20:21:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> 4. at the subsequent board meeting we review the progress of steps 2 and 3
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">20:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and how do we know who the relevant stakeholders are? :)
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">20:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> meeting(s)
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">20:22:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I think that it will become evident as we talk through the pieces
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">20:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">20:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> henne,   we post widely and broadly the community.   People who feel they have a stake will speak up.  Those who don't won't.  :-)
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">20:22:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> can we have everybody review it?
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">20:22:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> and the wiki is readable so if we miss somebody they can jump in
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">20:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> +1, and also everybody have input on it
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">20:23:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> What about role of the communityon all that?
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">20:23:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> What about role of the community on all that?
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">20:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we are the community
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">20:23:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> we can have everybody review it.  i was believing the board could look first to save people time
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">20:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   I think that was already stated.  Isn't community a stake holder?
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">20:23:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> oh
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">20:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">20:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> kindo of like a code review ;-)
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">20:24:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the community are all stakeholders together...
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">20:24:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> although I am a bit olst here
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">20:24:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I was going to say henne the same thing
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">20:24:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> yes all are stake holders but not all care about all issues
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">20:24:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I agree with that
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">20:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> but that was the issue the last 90 minutes: the missing transparency and if again "the board" reviews, its still not there imo
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">20:25:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> sorry that I have to say that
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">20:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so let AlanClark work on the wiki page
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">20:25:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> I'm not saying that they do it in isolation
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">20:25:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> in the meanwhile i setup opensuse-foundatio@opensuse.org
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">20:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and announce it
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">20:25:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> it's missing an n
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">20:25:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and once AlanClark has finished we review it on that list
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">20:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> foundation
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">20:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> dragotin,  it'll be on the wiki which isn't private anyway.   and with history, you can see what was put in there
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">20:25:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dragotin&gt;</span> good, so the discussion that you, alan, use as an important input, happens on @foundation?
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">20:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think this would be the right direction to get all stakeholders that care together
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">20:27:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm happy with it
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">20:27:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> should the address be this opensuse-foundation@opensuse.org?

<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">20:27:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if it all happens in the ML I totally agree
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">20:27:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> and not opensuse-foundatio@opensuse.org?

<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">20:39:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AlbertoP,   the less is what made this fall apart in the first place.  That's the point here.

<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">20:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> no, what made it fall apart is the slow decisional process

<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">20:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> you have been talking about the foundation for years... involving too many people is going to make the discussion longer and less conclusive. That was my point. Like it or not.

<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">20:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AlbertoP:</span>  Which is why I stated earler "direct points and issues"
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">20:42:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlbertoP&gt;</span> no need to explain much... your foundation, your time, your decision... it was just a suggestion

<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oldcpu&gt;</span> what would foundation membership consist of ? factory-developers + baseline-maintainers + 3rd party packagers + various levels of user support (mailing lists, irc , forums ) ? or should it be more focused on specific contributors (financial, corporate, volunteer ? )
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">20:47:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> save that for the wiki
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">20:47:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oldcpu,   all valid questions and should be directed to the actual wiki + ML discussion group.    Here we're only talking about ensuring its open
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">20:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> or the ML
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">20:47:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">oldcpu:</span> opensuse members will become foundation members

<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">20:47:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;oldcpu&gt;</span> ok - looking forward to the wiki :)
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">20:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but lets discuss this on the list
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">20:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> that should be vetoable
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">20:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> anything else on foundation?
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">20:48:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we're done on it.   We got the main thrust of what we needed to talk about taken care of
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">20:48:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">20:48:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bitshuffler:</span> we'll discuss on the respective ML, but the idea is that opensuse member can become foundation member if he/she wants to
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">20:48:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AlanClark&gt;</span> done enough for today
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">20:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> then lets continue to the next topic
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">20:49:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bitshuffler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> want is fine with me, I'm just against forced and or automatically

<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">20:49:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> are the relevant membership committee people present?
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">20:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR ?
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">20:49:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> there was an "incident" with the membership election comittee
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">20:49:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> one?
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">20:50:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> I'm almost sleeping meanwhile but I'm still here listening
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">20:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> but then again I wrote everything I wanted to say anyway
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">20:50:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR,  your concerns were valid and we'd like to address them and put it to good rest
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">20:51:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yes. so the issue is about the voting rules
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">20:51:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its not clear to the team how votes are calculated
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">20:51:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> we initially said +4 votes is enough
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">20:52:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> but never stated how +4 is calculated
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">20:52:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes, it is not clear what we meant with +4
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">20:52:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> the specific issue here was that there are 4 positive and one negative vote
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">20:52:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> whether it is 4x+1 or the sum of all votes is &gt;= 4
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">20:53:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well to put some historical perspective, when we, the board, did the voting,  voting was closed when an applicant received either +3 or -3, not the sum total of 3 votes.
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">20:53:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> and thats what i would like to continue
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">20:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so 4x+1 or 4x-1 it is right?
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">20:54:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it makes the most sense.  You can't assume unanimity in every application
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">20:54:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,  I believe so.
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">20:54:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> henne is there a deadline?
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">20:54:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> a deadline for what?
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">20:54:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> a deadline until the votes have to be done?
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">20:54:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> no.
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">20:54:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> okay, I fixed: http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#voting_about_tickets
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">20:55:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so that means if noone votes it never get positve or negative decided

<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">20:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> at least one thing is made clear now, thanks
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">20:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> and that happend last time or?
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">20:55:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wolfiR:</span> there are others?

<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">20:55:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a deadline wouldn't resolve positive or negative.   it wouldn't resolve anything really.

<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">20:57:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i think it can't be. its an opinion...
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">20:58:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> ok, we have the usual checklist
<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">20:59:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> but then there is some mail, that there is someone very important applying for membership
<a name="l-508"></a><span class="tm">20:59:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> problem is that only two people ever heard of that person
<a name="l-509"></a><span class="tm">20:59:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> but immediately there are a lot of people voting positively
<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">20:59:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR,   I'm guessing you're referring to when i vouched for someone recently
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">21:00:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> I'm sure we rejected a lot during the past months which should have got a chance compared to what we did in some cases

<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">21:00:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i felt 'the disturbance in the force' as well
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">21:01:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think it is a valid concern here.   And there are indeed corner cases that crop up from time to time.
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">21:01:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> I know it's very hard to do the right thing and therefore I'm just telling that the transparency and fairness of the process is not as I would like it to be
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">21:01:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> wolfiR,   Here's a question...  just so we can find a way to make this work out better....
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">21:02:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wolfiR:</span> but thats why we said from the beginning: if in doubt grant it
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">21:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wolfiR:</span> be inclusive not exclusive
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">21:02:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">henne:</span> the problem is elsewhere
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">21:02:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> In some of our teams, we see people doing work that isn't easily verifiable via the standard checklists.   That sometimes happens in ambassor cases as well.   And in the past we would always ping someone in that knowledgeable area to find out what the person's background is.
<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">21:03:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> where?
<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">21:03:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> however, when someone vouches,  say me, or someone else, that doesn't necessarily mean you *have* to vote positive either.
<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">21:03:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i think the problem that wolfiR is trying to describe is that nothing special is happening, people are voting as usual
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">21:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I have a related  question if I may?
<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">21:03:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but suddenly there is a certain iniciative that we should look at one particular ticket and vote
<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">21:03:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   as in the votes aren't "sacred" so to say?

<a name="l-528"></a><span class="tm">21:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i am not saying that we were told to vote positive, just vote, but still
<a name="l-529"></a><span class="tm">21:04:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> read the member page on the wiki
<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">21:04:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I am asking because I did
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">21:04:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> okay. thats indeed awkward
<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">21:04:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> i agree
<a name="l-533"></a><span class="tm">21:04:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wolfiR:</span> is that what bothered you?
<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">21:04:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> its pretty clear there
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">21:05:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i stand behind my vote and i didn't voted positively because i read the email or whatever
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">21:05:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok here is where there are two areas of expediency I believe we should follow:
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">21:05:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but it was weird to see please take a look at this ticket
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">21:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> a) Because we need to clear up applications prior to elections
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">21:05:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> as said, it's just a bad feeling I have with many applications to try to give them the same chance
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">21:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> b) Because a prospective candidate needs the membership before declaration
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">21:06:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but other than those two... I would not advocate unusual expediency for any other scenarios
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">21:06:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> I am ok with a)
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">21:06:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but I disagree with b)
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">21:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> i would like everybody to just refrain from pushing anyone through the membership process
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">21:06:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> really
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">21:07:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> who decides who is a prospective candidate or not?
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">21:07:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the prospective candidate
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">21:07:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> from my POV it would be OK to say, please take a look at the tickets, there are 17 pending ones
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">21:07:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> although you could argue that the prospective candidate should have applied long in advance for membership  :-)
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">21:07:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and this happenned a lot of times
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">21:07:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but saying please look at this request is hmm, how to say it, fishy
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">21:07:59 </span><span class="nka">* gnokii</span> <span class="ac">hear from two and saw only one name calling one only isnt so democratic</span>
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">21:08:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> yeah but speaking up for some particular member can be done by a vote
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">21:08:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> BTW,  I have never pushed for any individual.  Just for the record of anyone wondering here.   I only entered a vouch in an email
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">21:08:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> by board members that is
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">21:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> apparently already this created awkwardness...
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">21:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed, I can see that
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">21:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> so lets just not do that again
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">21:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's put in the workflow page that prusnak just updated that we do not welcome specific-member pushes.
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">21:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> its only us additional to the membership team that can see candidates
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">21:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we can still offer vouching where needed.  That's been a valuable tool int he past.  Especially in foreign language circles.
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">21:10:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> well, i guess it should be automatic, no need to mention that
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">21:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but not push.   That should be against protocol.
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">21:10:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> vouche by putting in your vote
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">21:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no henne
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">21:10:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it's like putting "We don't deal drugs on openSUSE conference" on the conference flyer

<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">21:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> recall some of the ones in the past... like when yaloki used to ping someone in the Russian camp and ask for background info  and then we would rely on that info to the best of our abilities
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">21:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> 8)
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">21:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> this is something completely different then mailing the membership team
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">21:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Vouching is okay as a source of information.  But it should be treated as just that...  informational source.  Not a vote.
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">21:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> this is verifying
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">21:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes henne    and I am saying what you said is that a vouch is a vote...
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">21:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and I'm saying no a vouch is not a vote.
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">21:12:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I only have seen a mail from Thomas not yours in the beginning
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">21:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and we should not be in a position to be pushed on specific member requests.  I agree completely with that.
<a name="l-577"></a><span class="tm">21:12:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> the point is that izabel would get the votes anyway
<a name="l-578"></a><span class="tm">21:12:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> maybe not in time, but she would get them
<a name="l-579"></a><span class="tm">21:12:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but the email caused lots of problems and this rather long discussion

<a name="l-581"></a><span class="tm">21:12:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> agreed

<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">21:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;henne&gt;</span> okay. i think we all agree :)
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">21:13:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so prevent that specific request scenario from happening again

<a name="l-602"></a><span class="tm">21:15:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so sometimes its not even the fault of the prospective candidate.

<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">21:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfiR&gt;</span> thanks, I guess we covered as much as possible. The rest is pretty much the fact that it's hard to get a feeling for applicants
