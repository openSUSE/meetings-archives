<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> its printed out on my desk
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:11:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I'll let you know tomorrow
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:12:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> please don't forget to mention opensolaris thingie
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well if there's anything relevant, I'd like us to be able to comment on it before you guys meet on Monday
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> you mean the current opensolaris thingie, right?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:12:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what's the opensolaris thingie?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we are percieved more similarly to oracle/opensolaris than redhat/fedora
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:12:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sn7&gt;</span> How so?
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:12:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> good point, I'll send the document around to you guys
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:13:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> opensolaris basically died because of oracle management
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> i wonder what kind of news you read if you haven't noticed that :)
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   ok so how will that relate to foundation?  Just curious
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:14:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">michl received an updated document on openSUSE Foundation and will share it with the Board</span>
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:14:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">for Monday there is a meeting scheduled with Alan and jospoortvliet</span>
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> novell execs were asking why redhat does not have foundation for fedora
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   honestly when sun became oracle...  I lost interest and distrust in anything that goes on over there.   I expect everything to die under the Oracle star
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> the point is that we are not percieved in public like FOSS company (redhat) but rather than software company (oracle)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes, Oracle, openSolaris should be mentioned in it as well
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:15:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so foundation will help us significantly (when talking about perception in public)
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:15:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sn7&gt;</span> Now, Novell has not exactly terminated openSUSE nor looks to be planning in doing so.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:16:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sn7:</span> no, this is not going to happen
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:16:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but opensolaris case is exactly the reason why having a foundation is good thing
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I think the better way to push it (and yes using opensolaris as an example) is to emphasize that we haven't achieved a sense of identity and ownership from the community wrt openSUSE    and thus a Foundation would greatly enhance that perception by the public
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:16:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> Gents, please excuse me for a minute
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok we've gone silent or I've lost my internet connection again
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:19:45 </span><span class="nka">* michl</span> <span class="ac">s back</span>
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:20:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> your connections seems alright
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> next topic ?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Trademark Approval</span>
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:20:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure I have another topic
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:20:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ahh  right in that vein   perfect!
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> did we all clean up our trademark approvals?
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:21:20 </span><span class="nka">* michl</span> <span class="ac">summarized the ones in the queue and proposed based on the votes a accept or reject</span>
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:22:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there's one that was raised in the queue and I have further questions/issues about this
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> if I doesn't hear differently I will send out tomorrow the accept or rejct mails
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:22:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you mean the furniture one ?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no, that one I endorse
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you shouldn't
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:22:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm referring to the one about the guy in UK who wants to resell openSUSE for 5 pounds
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:22:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:23:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> your question please ?
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:23:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and saw henne raised the issue of whether this is acceptable based on open-slx   and I have a broader issue about open-slx that we should clarify today
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> when you queried the board last year for any objections to open-slx being the exclusive redistributor, we didn't have any objections.   But now I'm finding the agreement seems highly secretive
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:24:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> just for people not knowing open-slx, this is the company who produce ans sell the openSUSE retail box
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:24:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we don't know the terms of the agreement, we do not know if people are allowed to redistribute at a nominal cost, I asked rupert a couple of weeks ago for info about open-slx status and every question was answered with "Sorry, NDA... can't discuss"
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:24:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> why's that ?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:25:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ask me ;-)
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we can't even know how well those boxes are selling so its hard for us on marketing team to know where market penetration is good.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   Well that's what I'm asking for clarification on here.  What is secretive and what isn't?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:26:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> see http://en.opensuse.org/Statistics
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sn7&gt;</span> That reminds me.. prusnak (or who had the idea?) should finish popcoRn.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:27:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> scroll down, dvd-biarch is the retail box and it reflects kind of 2-3.5% of all installations
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and wrt market penetration, the retail box is very EMEA centric and in there kind of 85% or so are sold in Germany
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:28:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> open-slx has the right to do the retail box
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,  dvd-biarch includes the promoDVDs?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> when it comes to I burn openSUSE media and sell it for some bugs this doesn't infere open-slx business
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:28:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so it is allowed for everyone
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:29:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no promodvd is a seperate item just below bi-arch
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sn7:</span> i am in contact with guy who is implementing this feature in smolt
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   ok
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so you answered 2 of 3 questions I had...
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> what was third?
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:30:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 3rd question is does a portion of sales come back to openSUSE in some way?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:30:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no money involved in the agreement
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but open-slx will contribute back to the project when the business is healthy
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and they already did, eg wiki transition
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes, there was big money in that  :-)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so the whole "Sorry, NDA!" was a bit over the top then
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:32:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> more secrets to publish ?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no but just would like us to remind open-slx to work more closely with the artwork team and the marketing team in openSUSE in future
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:33:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:34:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   you have any comments on this topic?  otherwise michl  can move on
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:34:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> well, i was just told that it is hard to communicate with open-slx guys
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but i don't have my own experience
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I think that could be resolved with better interaction.  Right now,  we don't see them here
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:35:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> so, if you don't have your own experience you shouldn't talk bad thing you heard ;-)
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's right!   For example, I heard good things about michl, but without my own experience, I won't talk about it
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> that's why I did emphasize the no own experience part
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> for "hard to communicate" you always need two sides involved

<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:36:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i don't want to dig into this topic further now
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:36:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we are missing two important people for this - rupert and henne

<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:37:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> can you give an insight?

<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:38:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;VenomVelvet&gt;</span> may I ask a question to the previous topic?

<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:39:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I just noticed that the membership # is slowly rising but in users.o.o I see a queue of 50 or so
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:40:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> according to GPL2 this is okay
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> VenomVelvet,   as long as its a nominal cost (to help reduce costs for the distributor) and is not significantly changed, we're supporting it
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:41:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;VenomVelvet&gt;</span> sounds like the licence to print money to me but ok...
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:41:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and from our side it is okay to use our trademarks if no bit is changed (software wise)

<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">18:42:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> VenomVelvet,   In fact it is useful in certain countries to allow this where people have poor internet service but there are "CD Burning" companies to alleviate that in their countries for a few bucks
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">18:42:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;VenomVelvet&gt;</span> yes... ok. agreed
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">18:42:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I think michl just challenged us.  Wanna go into business?  :-)
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">18:43:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:43:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's get back to membership topic.  I have some concerns here.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:43:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#1   </span><span class="cmdline">When we outsourced membership, the idea was to a) get this off our plate and b) have a team come up with efficient ways to streamline the procecss for speedier approvals</span>
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:43:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> JFYI I wrote an email to membership-officials if they need help from my side
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:44:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#2  </span><span class="cmdline">While we have outsourced it, technically the membership is still our domain.   And while its good we outsourced, we have turned this into an "out of sight/out of mind" thing in that we're not regularly keeping tabs on the process</span>
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:45:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#3 </span><span class="cmdline">I'm getting complaints lately that some people have waited a loooong time for their approvals, just like when we did our own approvals.  So looks like we didn't acheive much here.</span>
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:45:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and you propose to do what?
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:46:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Figure out where we went off track from our original goal
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:46:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   has there been any assessment in the team about how to streamline the process?
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> the process is set up, it is much effective than it used to be when we used wiki
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:47:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> ... much more ...
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:47:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> how so?
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:47:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it will be even more effective once we get rid of that copying
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:48:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> yes, I think the manual copying is a big hurdle
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:48:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> effective =&gt; intuitive and easy
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:48:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:48:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and opens the door for a growing queue
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:48:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it is not more effective
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> because people don't have motivation to do that
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:48:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i guess
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> when we did the work last year, we usually took about 4-6 weeks turnaround.   Any indication what the turnaround time is now?
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:49:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:49:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> 2 tickets - 3 months ago
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:49:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> also want to mention when I applied for GNOME Foundation membership, I got approved in like 2 weeks.  Really fast.   How can we mimic that?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:49:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> 2 tickets - 2 months ago
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:49:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> the rest is under 4 weeks
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> and maybe the ones in users.o.o are missing here
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:50:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no actually it was 1 week not 2
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:50:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> sure, i'm talking about retro now
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:50:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but I don't like to compare what was some time ago
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   the ticket dates are when it was entered in retro.  Correct?  not when the application was filed?
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:51:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:51:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> GNOME project is 11 years old today, openSUSE is around four
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> do you want to compare effectivness of processes in these two projects?
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:51:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> key will be one person who takes over responsility and push others to vote
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:51:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   sure, but doens't mean we can't learn from what others do.
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:52:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> that is the wrong approach I guess
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:52:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i was filling the tickets before
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:52:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> I doubt, it worked with the Board membership approvals that way
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> I stopped doing it a month and a half ago
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:52:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and since then noone created new ticket or indicated the need for help
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:53:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> when I start doing it again we'll have single point of failure again
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I move that one way or another, we get this queue of ~70 applicants approved by mid-Sept
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:54:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> I mean - I can do it
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> it will take me less than an hour
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   I agree with that issue you have.   I guess some automated ticket-creation process would be helpful
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:54:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> but is that what we want ?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:54:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no that isn't,  it defeats the whole purpose of why we did this in the first place
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:54:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> it would be helpful but we have noone who will do it
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:55:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> so we have to stick to crappy  copy-paste
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> for now
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok we're muddling two separate issues here
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:55:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> issue 1:  Efficient and automated process of populating the tickets
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:55:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Issue 2:  Backlog of applicants who are screaming for approval
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:56:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i disagree
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> we have one issue
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:56:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> both can be solved with one person take the responsibility and push others
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:56:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> membership officials are not working like we expected
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:56:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i.e. they are not autonomous
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:57:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> here's my issue....
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:57:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> do they have access to users.o.o ?
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:57:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> yes, all is set up correctly to my best knowledge
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:57:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I've got ambassadors who have already proven their merit for membership.  They are applying and want to print up business cards with @o.o addresses.  They can't do so until membership is approved.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:58:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> and if it wasn't i would expect someone to complain
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:58:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> so what makes them no autnomous ?
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:58:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> lack of time? lack of motivation?
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> i don't know
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and as "event season" is fast approaching us, this is holding back their ability to develop their materials for distribution
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:59:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> you know that nothing is blocking you from creating the tickets in retro, right? :-)
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> prusnak,   that's not the point...
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:00:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> if we can agree that I should file all remaining users from users.o.o to retro.o.o I will do it tomorrow
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the point is we outsourced it and netierh you n or me should have to do that.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">prusnak:</span> maybe a friendly reminder to the approval team list ?
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:00:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  do that first
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:01:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> I did it already
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:01:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> it doesn't be solved in a day but it should move ahead again
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusnak&gt;</span> okay, next topic
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">where do we fail?</span>
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:02:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I guess that's just a carry over from last meeting, right?
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">19:02:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no that's a permanent topic
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> but I have one question, what is meant by Services Documentation ?
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:03:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's my AI,  I need to discuss with henne further about proper location/page
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:03:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> basically in the last meeting we agreed we needed admin@o.o to be more prominent on our pages and then we agreed that other key contact info should also be there  such as press@o.o, etc.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:04:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> ahh, now I get it
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so it'll get taken care of this week  (unless henne is out this week?)
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:05:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> don't know, at least yesterday I've seen him and today he was active in IRC
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:05:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so there is hope ;-)
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">19:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">19:06:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we can close this topic as we pretty much identified "where we failed" in other topics  :-)
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> right
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">19:07:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so thanks to holiday season we're having a rather short meeting and coming to the #topic Q&amp;A's
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">19:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   Can you take the aI also to inform henne and rupert that we have tentatively discussed having board F2F on the Monday prior to Conf?

<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">19:08:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's get that nailed down so we can plan travel arrangements
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">19:08:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as I'll be traveling in Europe, I'll need to know whether to depart for NUE on Sun or Mon
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">19:08:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and then prusnak will have to give me some tips on Praha for post-Conf visitation

<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">19:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> impressed I said "Praha"?  :-)
