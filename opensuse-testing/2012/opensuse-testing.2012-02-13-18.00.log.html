<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:02:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I think, we left it in from last time
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Is there anything new to add?
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:03:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> not from my side. I'll continue to have an eye on the openQA tests, so that the core OS remains stable.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:04:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I downloaded both the x86_64 NET install and the KDE Live CD. Both installed on VB VMs and looked pretty good.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:04:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> good evening
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:04:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> jradzuweit: welcome and good evening
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:04:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> hi
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I started the most-annoying-bugs-12.2 list today
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:05:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> The repos are screwy, but that is easily fixed. Hi jradzuweit.
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i have download build 151, and had some issues with the live iso`s but the net install iso worked for me
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep. fix is on the way to factory for MS2
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:06:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> what were those issues?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:07:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well the gnome iso failed to load the desktop , i got the screen saying sorry gnome has crashed
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:07:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> the kde iso is even weird
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#link </span><span class="cmdline">http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_12.2_dev</span>
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:07:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> the boot process goes well until its starting to load kde
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:07:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> How so? KDE seemed to work for me.
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:08:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> after the icons showing kde components being loaded and untill i see the full kde desktop
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:08:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i had  to wait 10 minutes
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> BUT
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:08:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> how much RAM does your machine have?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i was happy tha the net install iso worked, even if an checksum error poped up
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> 512
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> too little for LiveCDs
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I use 1 GB - that was OK.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:09:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> mysql alone wastes ~150MB (for akonadi)
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i have posted more feedback here http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/pre-release-beta/472247-re-opensuse-12-2-milestone-1-a.html
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i have 2gb of ram
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:10:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> so the maximum value that i can use would be 768 mb of ram
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:10:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> does the host use so much?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:11:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but even 768MB should be an improvement
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:11:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well as far as i notice from widgets i tend to use 600mb with firefox, pidgin, skype and clementine
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:11:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> and of course other desktop components
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:11:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I have 3 GB, but have had two VMs running with 1 GB each.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:11:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> akonadi and nepomuk are disabled :D
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> lucky you

<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> is a good machine. you could try writing the LiveCD.iso to a USB-stick and boot it on the physical machine (no need to install)

<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i do just that bmwiedemann
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:13:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> ah. good :)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> or i just boot the iso inside vbox without installing it :)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> just like i do with a normal cd image, well dvd actually
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jradzuweit:</span> do you have any proposal on how to better structure our testing?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> not idea
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> testopia is a dead horse I think
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:15:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> didn't helped much in past
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:15:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes. it would need a lot of love to keep alive
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:16:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I could never figure out how to use testopia.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> the only way I can think of is to extend openQA
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well maybe the developer who created it has an idea
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:17:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> The beta forum has been quite active since Friday - there is a lot of testing of MS1.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jradzuweit:</span> I'm doing it sometimes and maybe some other people will contribute test modules in the future.
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:18:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> that is good to have people test it before RCs (when it is too late)
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> For the good news: wireless networking works very well with build 151: WEP, WPA and WPA2
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i got no connection issues to internet from vbox either after installing M1 using build 152
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:21:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> removed the opensuse 12.1 repo`s from M1 and runned a dup just to be on the "pure" factory snapshot
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:22:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> NET install connected to the wired network in VBox with no problems. I did not try wireless with it.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:22:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> would be nice to add some zypper lines to do that as workaround to the most-annoying-bugs list
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:22:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> so what is the plan for 12.2, has anybody a idea?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> test plan? or overall? It will have OpenStack cloud software at least
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:23:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> I guess overall
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:24:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> do we focus on cloud software, or something else?
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> apart from that, it depends what people push. will have newer software all-around
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:25:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Does anyone here use the cloud in a meaningful way?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:25:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I did a few times.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:26:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> My uplink is only 512 Kbps, but down is 10 Mbps. Needless to say, I don't do much uploading.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> yes that would be nice
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:26:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we have our internal cloud, which is very useful, because you can get a running VM with ssh from it within a minute
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:27:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> i dont use cloud at all :)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:27:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> not even dropbox or spider oak even if i had accounts there
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Me either.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i`m an old fashioned user, that has a 500gb extern hdd for files :)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:28:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Off-site backup has some appeal, but DVDs in the fire-proof safe suffice for now. In addition, I have lots of external drives.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> there is a surprising number of sites that don't have their own datacenter, but just run off the cloud.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:29:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> does opensuse has such sites ?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:30:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> no. just openSUSE images on amazon EC2
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> has anyone installed gnome 3 from net install iso? does it work ?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:32:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> http://openqa.opensuse.org/viewimg/opensuse/testresults/openSUSE-NET-x86_64-Build0152-gnome/xterm-2.png fallback mode worked
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> which is the expected thing on non-3D hardware
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:34:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well i was thinking to install g3 and after that to add guest additions
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:35:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:35:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> shall we move to the second topic then - Testing Core Team wiki page ?
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> If the host has 3D acceleeration, is that enough for g3 in VBox?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> I think, you need hardware-virt and guest additions to have 3D for g3
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:37:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Thanks.

<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> this is the subject proposed by me

<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:39:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> so we have no plan, right?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> everyone testing to his liking
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:40:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jradzuweit:</span> well i guess we each can test in his own way according to his skills
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:40:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we could email sometimes about what we tested, so others interested in the same area can contact you.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:40:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> And needs.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:40:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> yes and needs
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:41:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> ok, freestyle testing
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:41:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i think i just spotted a bug right now.; never seen apper sentinel untill i did ps -aux but the darn thing has hanged :)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:41:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jradzuweit:</span> but some coordination would be nice. what would you like to test?

<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:43:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so they silently wait for the lock to be released?
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> since tomorow is val`s day i will start some testing on my own: install gnome 3, guest additons and report on that topic from the opensuse forum is that ok with you guys ?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:44:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jradzuweit&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I think not of what I like, rather what is good for the distro

<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:45:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jradzuweit:</span> think of any programs that you could not live without... and maybe write openQA tests for them (or just list them, so that I can have a go)
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:46:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i was saying in reply to bmwiedemann way of coordinating what we do and of course feedback

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">18:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> because this is what developers use - and they fix it

<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:56:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> as some of you know the wiki page from here http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_Core_team was modified
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:56:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> the main change is the list of contributors, that was reduced to 3 coordinating members
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> plus informations for future contributors
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> do you think that we need to add or remove something from the page ?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:58:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I was wondering about the "stable version" part - isn't that were all users are testers and could file bugs?
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:58:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> s/were/where/
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:59:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> "Test and report bugs found on the stable version of openSUSE again using Bugzilla"
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:59:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> you mean that ?
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:59:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> of course, we also do that, but more than every other user?
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:59:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well personally when i`ve created that i had mind the fact that some users may fell scared of factory
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:00:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> so i have try to underline that they could use a stable version of opensuse to help with testing
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:00:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> there is a Beta and 2 RCs for them
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:00:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> so what do you suggest bmwiedemann ?
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:01:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> problem is that once the stable release is out (actually even around RC2) only big+important bugs will be fixed, as otherwise the risk to break things would be too big.
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:01:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i see
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:02:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> then i can remove that and leave just the first sentence
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> "Test and report bugs on Factory, Milestones and Release Candidates using Bugzilla"
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:02:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so testing on the stable release is a lot less useful than testing on the Beta
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:02:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> ok, i will remove that
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:03:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Even though stable bugs might not be fixed, reporting them is still important for the next release.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> btw, does anyone has something againts the fact that the list is reduced just to coordinating members ?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:03:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> especially, when you describe, what we as the more advanced testers do... I always want to find the bad bugs before they hit less technical users.
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:05:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> its a long way for be to be an advanced tester
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:05:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> The reason for just the coordinating members is that the 3 of us are here nearly all the time. Others that were on the list contribute, and some had never participated.
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:05:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> so everyone agress that the respective line "Test and report bugs found on the stable version of openSUSE again using Bugzilla" should be removed ?
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Holgi did not want to make an arbitrary cut based on subtle shades of participation, thus the choice of 3.
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:06:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> just doing my duty to ask since i was the one that edited the page :)
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:07:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> The line can stay. Some bugs will be fixed.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:08:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> any other wiki page questions/issues/ideas?
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> None for me.
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> same here

<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i have a question: is 12.2 gona have the usr/ usr/bin and so on merge ?
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:15:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> like fedora is trying
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> From what I read on the Factory ML, people are working in that direction, but it is unlikely for 12.2
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">19:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> I know that one guy is changing some packages towards it, but it already broke our installer twice... so I hope he is not over-hasting it
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:16:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Plymouth is the other new possibility.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:16:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> so at leats 12.2 is gonna be in the "usual" mode
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:16:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> plymouth ?
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:16:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> for graphical boot with splashscreen
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> what is wrong with the one that open suse has already ?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:17:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> My hope is that systemd gets stabilized before anything else in boot changes.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:18:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Anyone here have systems that fail with systemd?
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">19:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> my systems are working fine here
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">19:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> My main laptop failed with systemd until the 2nd update after GM.

<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">19:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> All are OK now.
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">19:19:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Creatura85:</span> it needs extra kernel patches, that take effort to maintain (and only we use them)
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">19:19:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> well i can only hope for the best regarding plymouth
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">19:20:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> What part of the kernel needs patching? I don't use those.
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">19:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> I had some trouble at the beginning (ntp, postfix, apparmor, firewall) - but things improved with the updates
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">19:21:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> I think, there is a bootsplash kernel patch. without it, you just get the framebuffer console with the "done" messages
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">19:22:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Thanks. As I always want to see console messages, I don't miss anything.
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">19:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> i like the messages from the console bmwiedemann they give the feel of a transparent OS
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">19:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Creatura85&gt;</span> that show`s how it starts
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">19:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> My last problem was with NFS mounts with wireless - those were fixed by switching to automount.
