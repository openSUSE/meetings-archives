<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">18:03:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Seems to be shaping up nicely.  Nouveau has made a solid improvement since 11.3
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:04:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> in terms of performance or stability?
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Both.  I haven't had a crash or screen corruption so far.  Additionally the system moves at a usable pace.
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:04:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I still have an i915 problem with drm in 2.6.37, but that is upstream.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I had installed Factory-tested on my old Via-based laptop and fbdev graphics are sometimes awfully slow.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:06:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I agree, 11.4M4 looks pretty good. Cannot burn CDs due to k3b problem.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:06:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> I succeeded doing that als root :-&gt;
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> Kodos for factory-testing. It is good to do a rolling update without woryy that system will boot.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:07:36 </span><span class="nka">* HolgiDE</span> <span class="ac">I'm using M4 on my workstation without major problems</span>
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:08:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> the burning is like https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=656502
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> openSUSE bug 656502 in openSUSE 11.3 (KDE4 Applications) "K3b input/output error burning bluray BD-R" [Critical,New]
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:08:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and yes, factory-testing is a nice thing to have :) they broke factory twice during the first 36h after I published factory-testing :D
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> err. "factory-tested"
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:10:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I also had problems with sntp on factory after MS4
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:10:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I need to read that bug report carefully. I'm not sure it is the same as mine fails on startup.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">HolgiDE:</span> I really hate to log into a GUI as root. I also have 11.3 on that box and can burn from it.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:11:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> that absolute correct to not use it as root
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> which bugs should we put on the most-annoying list? the k3b one and the zypper one?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> kdesu k3b could work
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> bug #656060 from M3 is still open
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> bug 656060 from M3 is still open
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:14:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I get an error box saying a configuration file now writable, but that should be fixable.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Edit /now/not/
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:18:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> otherwise no additional big issues from my point of view
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> next topic would be "GNOME 3.0 Redux" - whose is that?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:18:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> None for me either. I had a small one with Build 0908 that was fixed on 0909.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> That topic is mine.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I spoke with Vincent Untz "vuntz" about GNOME 3
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> maybe you want to add bug# ti minutes with #info
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:19:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> s/ti/to/
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I was just looking for claification.  First about openQA's capability and second about what sort of commitment is possible from the team itself
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> do you have filed your k3b issue on bugzilla?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> not yet
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:23:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">discussed bug 657605, bug 656060 and an unfiled k3b bug as most prominent issues with M4</span>
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">GNOME 3.0 Redux</span>
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:24:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so the idea with GNOME 3.0 is to have automated testing for it on the openQA system?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Well that's one idea.  But i'd like to know if it's even possible.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:25:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> G3 uses openGL and I'm not sure how far along that is in KVM.
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> Mesa can do openGL
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> in pure software
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:26:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> So I'm asking before this goes to far and expectations develop.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:26:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Software raster, yes?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:26:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes. I suppose I should give it a try when I have some spare hour.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:27:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> what info could you collect from vuntz
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Ok, I told Vincent I would ask about this because I was unsure and some online reports on OpenGL + Virt weren't too encouraging.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I recently learned that you can use the "Add On Product" checkbox on the second installer screen to use extra repos
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:28:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Vuntz was A) excited that we were talking about testing it B) unsure if automated testing would work due to openGL being needed.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:28:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> I see
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:29:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Additionally he mentioned that they are still looking at bringing a G3 liveCD online, but it isn't high priority at this moment.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:29:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Since the GNOME Team's respin is due after 11.4 is out, we can help them test much closer to GM.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:29:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I am not sure how much openGL they use, because Mesa is often lacking behind the standard
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Right now it's not critical and it may not be feasible, but I just wanted to have accurate information.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:31:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> My other question was if people are available to looking at the G3 respin when the time comes.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:31:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">bmwiedemann will evaluate feasability of automated GNOME 3 testing on openQA</span>
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Seeing as this would take us in the "break period" I didn't want to over commit the Team.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Still, it would be good to be able to tell the GNOME Team "look we've got a sub-team of 4 who can help you on this" or whatever the number is.
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:33:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> as long as openqa does the work ...
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Hehehe, well yest openqa would be a massive help.  But that's up in the air right now.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:34:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Think about it, and we can look into solid commitments at the next meeting.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:34:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> That way people can get a good look at schedules and whatnot.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:35:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> I only have two laptops here, one with fbdev which will be too slow and one with intel that I would prefer to not break, so I will mostly do VM-testing of GNOME3
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:35:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> If you notify the testing ML when you would like testing, I'll spread the word on the forum.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:35:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Sounds great.  Any testing will help.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:36:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I'll let vuntz know where things stand for now and hopefully things will continue to take shape as we approach release.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:36:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> but that will not start before we get the gnome3.0 live dvd?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:37:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">HolgiDE:</span> there are repos for that, that could work, too...
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Right.   Of couse we could test the preview packages and report upstream.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:37:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> But I know that right now the focus is on 11.4
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:37:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:38:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I was just curious about our capacity to help out a fellow team with their side-project.
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> It's sort of funny for me because I'm a KDE guy, but I like that as a project all the desktops get love.  So I'm trying to help us make a good first impression, like with Smeegol.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:39:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> wow

<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:40:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> Include repo info as well.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:41:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> Ok, I'll do that.
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:41:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and pointers on how to setup, how to use the cool new features etc

<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:42:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> last topic on prepared agenda
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> This topic is mine as well.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:43:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> When I got around to put up the last meeting's minutes, bmwiedemann had already slept, ate, and posted them.  So I put up the archive minutes I had on file.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:43:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> The problem is a number of the meetings I attended were from Web-clients and I didn't save the output.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:44:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> So it's just a call for anyone who happens to still have those transcripts to either post them or e-mail them to me so I can post them.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> r.seete AT googles-email-service .com
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:45:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I thought, we posted most of them on the old wiki
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:46:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> which transcripts are missing?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Many of them.

<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Although I do need to look at the old wiki.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:47:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> From this link however bmwiedemann is right that quite a number are archived.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I'll make new pages for them.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:48:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> very good :)

<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:50:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> I guess that closes the prepared agenda.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes. you can come up with more topics now.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:51:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> Actually I have a question.  Not sure if this has been addressed before.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:52:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I still need to de extensive wireless testing. No problems with quick test, but not ready for discussion.
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:52:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so ask it :)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:53:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> It looks like I may have an interview for a position here but I'm a recent graduate and don't have many references (yes, yes, irony).
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:53:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> So I was curious if A) it's possible to get a reference from volunteering in the oS Project and,
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:53:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> B) who would give it if it was possible?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:54:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> For B), I think Holgi.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> I'm not familiar with the reference stuff because we don't use that in Germany
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:55:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HolgiDE&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ReferenceSeete:</span> what would that mean if someone is getting in touch with me?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:55:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> of course, quite a lot of your work will be visible publicly online. from meeting transcripts to git-commits.
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:55:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ReferenceSeete&gt;</span> A reference is basically a social stopgap for employers to avoid heavy research.
