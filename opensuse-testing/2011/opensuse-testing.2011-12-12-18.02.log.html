<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> shall I start?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:04:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:04:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> openQA has caught some issues that would very likely have remained unnoticed.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:04:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> a) last-minute bugs
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:04:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> b) rarely tested things (e.g. zdup from 11.3)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but I was still unsatisfied with 12.1-Beta and RC1 which suffered from major bugs
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=720571 that remained open for 3 weeks, 9 dups
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725722 that was introduced on last day, 9 dups
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but overall, we have seen worse with earlier releases (such as several Milestones of 11.3 not booting)
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:05:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> openSUSE bug 720571 in openSUSE 12.1 (X.Org) "X11 evdev segfault" [Critical,Resolved: duplicate]
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bugbot&gt;</span> openSUSE bug 725722 in openSUSE 12.1 (Installation) "Package Manager during installation crashes yast" [Critical,Resolved: fixed]
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:06:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> all this time spent on filing dups could have been spent to test/file other, new &amp; interesting bugs
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> at least for such last-minute-bugs - shouldn't we rather release some days later?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:07:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I find b.n.o searches for bugs to be frustrating - even when I know the bug has been filed.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:07:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> at least for Beta&amp;RC
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> yep. I filed a bug on "not finding DUPLICATEs"
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> often enough, you can go to Advanced and tell it to include RESOLVED bugs
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I also think the timing between releases in the final stages is too short.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Are we trying too much for an 8 month GM cycle?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:11:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> did you talk to coolo ?
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Holgi:</span> No.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> Bernhard ?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:11:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> coolo said, that after RC1, only bugfixes are included
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:12:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> That is OK, but what about the ones introduced in RC1 and RC2. They are the killers.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:13:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I think, the original planning had more time at the end, but some MS slipped and then things were rescheduled and squeezed together.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:14:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I do not understand what "only bugfixes are included"
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and as I understood it, coolo does not want the full freeze phase takes too long
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> should mean
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> infact bug reports do report problems
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:15:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> if fixes creates new problems
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:15:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> they may not be fixed then?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep. but it is supposed to remain more stable than in full factory mode when every new (beta)version gets in
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I agree that we do not put in new features at that time
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> but I think nobody requested
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> what we are worrying about is that bugs are not fixed or fixes causes new problems
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:17:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I once calced that the shortest useful release-test-report-fix-cycle is three weeks.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I also have issues (intel graphics) that does not get fixed - as always, developer orders his bugs, renames it but do not fix anything
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:19:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> The RC timing is a problem for the many testers that do not even start with a new release until RC1.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we had 3 weeks between Beta and RC1, which was good, but between RC1-RC2 and RC2-GM was very little time
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:19:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> bnc#732308
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> bug 732308
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Holgi:</span> Despite your issues with i915, the KMS video drivers in 12.1 are much improved.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:20:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> bugbot does not like me
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:20:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> also I have random crashed when waking up
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> not report yet
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> most of those could be upstream issues, and we don't always have enough developers on that... or maybe the bugs just don't get to the right people
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:22:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> At least it seems to me that there are fewer complaints in the forums about graphics problems. For me, i915 (1 system) and nouveau (2 systems) both work.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:23:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> what do you guys think, what we should do again or do better for 12.2? so more time between RCs would be #1
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> to be honest - I have no idea
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:25:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> maybe we should change the pizza event: instead pizza for testing we offer pizza for bug fixing
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:25:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I think 12.1 was better than 11.4, but that was mostly openQA, and the rest of us can only bask in the glory.
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I think, the fixing did take place, because more developers actually ran 12.1 and saw bugs
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:25:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> regarding upstream: I would expect that such a bug report would go to solution "UPSTREAM" then
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but then people don't find the RESOLVED bug again
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:27:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but what helps an open bug where nobody is working on, just collecting all the duplicates?
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:27:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> how hard is it to setup a better bugtracker for openSUSE?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:28:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes, better open bugs, so that people see that it is known and still needs to be fixed.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:28:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> One thing that would help is to add the upstream developer to the bug report. For me, this happens with both Fedora and Ubuntu.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:28:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> if those have bnc accounts...
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:29:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Why cannot we add a non-user E-mail address?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:29:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> don't think we can.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> If the developer gets reports, they can always join later.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:30:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Should we change that policy?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> problem is, we have little control on bnc. =&gt; own bugtracker?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:31:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Is it controlled by Novell now?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> it is controlled by Novell still
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but I don't think this is the problem - I think you can make the developer make himself an account by opensing a bug in upstream bug tracker and just add URL of our bug
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:34:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> most will be curious enough ;-)
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but opensuse developer needs to do this, bug reporter usually don't know
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:34:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> if it's an opensuse problem or upstream problem
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Unfortunately, with bugzilla.kernel.org still down, there is no upstream bug tracker for kernel issues. Still, one can post to LKML.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:35:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> for me it's hard to understand that this is taking so long
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> we have same problems with LSB test suite
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:35:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> server still down
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:36:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> They are being very careful to check every piece so that the penetration point is not reopened.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:37:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I even lost my account at kernel.org because I live far away from any other kernel dev and have no way to get my key signed.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:38:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> where do you live?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> Greg K-H offered to sign keys on conferences
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Kansas City, Missouri, USA.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:38:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I see
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:39:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> As I no longer have an employer to pay, I no longer travel. If a conference comes to Kansas City or St. Louis, I'll go.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:39:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> any plans for vacation already? ;-)
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:40:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> If I tried to plan a vacation "to a conference", then it would cost me alimony.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> LOL
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:41:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> can we get back on topic?
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:41:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:42:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> regarding keys, I had issues with enigmail accessing key servers
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but this is fixed (but not released yet)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:42:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=733002
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so opening bugs in upstream bugtrackers for upstream bugs, it certainly a good thing to do.

<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:05:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Systemd has problems with NFS mounts when using wireless. After changing them to automount, all is good.
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> when I try to run automount in yast2, it ask me to setup ldap :-) why I don't have
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> which
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:07:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I admit, I did it from the command line. I did not know that YaST could do it.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:08:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but how to make it better? I expect systemd to mature more during 12.2 cycle, so we will likely not see these problems again (but grub2 is coming ;)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:09:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> for 12.2 what we really need is grub2 (or able to use efi, hdd &gt;3.5TB etc) + drakcut/plymouth so we can drop lot of shit that will goes wrong with systemd
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:10:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> I found systemd quite usefull, working great once setup correctly ...
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes, and I expect problems for those that dual-boot with Windows. Fortunately, not a problem for me.
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:10:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> can't grub2 chainload anymore?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> There's a lot of report about crypt+systemd, that need to be fixed too (also how to make encryption with btrfs :-)
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I don't know the details, just what I have read.
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:12:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> There is a new systemd that is supposed to fix that.
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:12:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Any ideas when btrfs will get a proper fsck?
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> not this year
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:15:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I think that the btrfs option on the installation page should have a warning. The noobs are the ones modt likely to trash their fs.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep. it's dangerous
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:17:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I had one response to my newsletter item about this meeting. That user noted that the final graphics are usually one of the last things.
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> He usually has many installs, and would like a change in graphics beginning with MS1.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Would a color change, or something else that is easy be possible?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:18:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we want that in 12.2 MS1. I already have a great draft for fallback artwork :D

<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> That would certainly catch ones eye.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so hopefully, all 12.2 releases will look different than 12.1
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:22:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> It is not a problem for me as my early testing is with VB, and I keep the VM machine labels up to date.
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:22:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I use kvm a lot. and I guess, this will help avoid confusion in many places.
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:26:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> any other proposals what to improve or what to repeat?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> then, we shall move to our next topic
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> It appears that the only support that YaST has for automount is with LDAP. That needs to be addressed. I use "direct mapping" for my mounts.

<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> should still be before MS1

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:31:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> One thing I would like to discuss is the makeup and the future of the TCT, but not today.
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:32:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes, I suppose, there are some things that could change

<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> sometimes, I had wished for a place, where I could simply drop some issue I stumbled upon when I didn't have time to file a bug... would need some people to monitor that and maybe try to reproduce &amp; file
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:39:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> firefox betas had an nice feedback button integrated for that
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:40:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> The forum for beta would be a good place for that kind of thing.
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:41:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> sometimes the forum was acting strange on me, though
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> How so? I usually read it with NNTP, and rarely soo the web interface.

<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:42:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I only read it in browser - and sometimes it wanted me to login and then again and again
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">19:42:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I think that is fixed now.
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">19:43:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> good :)
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">19:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> what ideas did you have to attract more people to test and file?
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">19:48:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I don't really have any. We need a good statement of what to do - most people don't file bugs, and too many start late in the cycle.
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">19:48:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> It seems that changing to a Beta did not help.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">19:49:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so we should tell them more about what happens if too few people test
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:49:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes. :)
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:49:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> One thing I did note - When Linus found a bug, it got fixed quickly.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:50:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> LOL
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">19:50:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> for one he supplied a patch. that is easy to apply
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">19:50:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but most reporters don't include a patch
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">19:51:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Which is why I always try to supply a patch for Linus's bugs, but I'm not usually successful.
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">19:51:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> But then, I don't get that many chances.
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">19:54:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> fixing bugs quickly would be a good way to motivate testers (but it is not always possible)
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">19:55:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Having them fixed before GM should also motivate them.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">19:56:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes. but fast feedback also feels nice. e.g. a "thanks for reporting this - I can reproduce it and will work on it as soon as possible" message would be nice sometimes
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">19:57:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Why does triage take so long?
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">19:58:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> a) because many bugs first go to screening team
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">19:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> b) because developers don't have comparable setup
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">19:59:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> or are busy at that time
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">20:01:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> or we organize more community members to watch the opensuse-bugs@opensuse.org ML

<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">20:27:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> I think it is the interaction of tar with the filesystem when the --sparse option is used but I am not an expert on how that works. - It only cropped up as I was doing testing of ReaR with btrfs which uses this option
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">20:30:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> what command do you use for decompression?
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">20:30:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> The only thing I can suggest is that you send the link to the bug report to the maintainer of btrfs and to the appropriate ML. Chris Mason &lt;chris.mason@oracle.com&gt;, and linux-btrfs@vger.kernrl.org.
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">20:31:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> I did not use compression - just tar
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">20:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> it has a --gzip flag for the tar creation ;)
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">20:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but what command do you use to "restore" the files from the tar?
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">20:33:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> just tar -xvf
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">20:34:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Is the --sparse needed for untarring?
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">20:36:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> the problem does not occur, when tarring from ext4 and untarring on btrfs. but happens when tarring on btrfs and untarring on ext - so the tar is already bad.
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">20:36:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> not that I know off and it does not make a difference - just tried it - I would not expect so as you never would know if somebody else has used that option in the first place
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">20:37:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> yes - I think you can also check  that the tar is bad with the --diff option
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">20:37:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> would be good to make a minimal reproducer from that
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">20:37:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> a two-line tar call is not so nice
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">20:38:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Hubba&gt;</span> I know but that is basically the line that ReaR uses internally
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">20:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Does it fail with tar --sparse zcvf /test.tar.gz   /etc
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">20:41:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">20:41:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> even with tar --sparse -cf /test.tar /etc
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">20:42:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> So, compression is not involved..
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">20:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> That definitely should be passed on to the btrfs developers.
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">20:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">20:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> One more reason to not use btrfs. :)
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">20:44:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> anyway. let us end our meeting. we can still trace these bugs after it
