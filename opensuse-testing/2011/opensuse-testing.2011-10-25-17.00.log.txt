17:00:55 <Holgi> good
17:01:10 <bmwiedemann> Hello everyone
17:01:10 <bmwiedemann> As always, today's agenda is on http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting
17:01:10 <bmwiedemann> You can still add to the agenda on the wiki while the meeting is in progress
17:01:33 <bmwiedemann> #topic RC1 experience
17:02:19 <bmwiedemann> I run RC1 on my desktop and a netbook. most things just work.
17:02:33 <bmwiedemann> but on my netbook, dhcpcd was not started on ifup wlan0
17:03:26 <LWFinger> I have not tried ifup, but it works witn NetworkManager.
17:03:40 <LWFinger> I'll test later.
17:04:10 <bmwiedemann> there are still some bugs seen from openQA test results, most things not too big
17:04:14 <Holgi> I have it on my workstation and found bug#726385
17:04:41 <Holgi> gpg encryption not working
17:06:16 <LWFinger> I have RC1 on my laptop, a desktop and a netbook (soon). Again most things work.
17:06:57 <LWFinger> I had a few failures with systemd booting - 1 in 3 tries failed, but an update seems to fix that.
17:07:43 <LWFinger> The plasmoid NM applet no longer requests the system password so oftem.
17:08:04 <Holgi> sometimes I was also lost with systemd
17:08:28 <Holgi> e.a. I tried to get init 5 by default by changing /etc/inittab
17:08:37 <Holgi> but this did not work
17:09:05 <bmwiedemann> yast2 runlevel  works
17:09:10 <Holgi> which is not a "surprise"
17:09:20 <bmwiedemann> or manipulating /etc/systemd/system/default.target
17:09:33 <Holgi> thx
17:09:53 <LWFinger> My laptop was updated from Factory - the desktop form the 12.1 repos.
17:10:27 <Holgi> I still need to learn
17:10:54 <bmwiedemann> #info 12.1 was branched from Factory after RC1 so these will now evolve more independently
17:11:17 <LWFinger> Switching from systemd to systemV using F5 now works again - it was broken for a while.
17:11:51 <bmwiedemann> it's good to have this fallback
17:12:11 <LWFinger> Yes - just in case.
17:12:45 <bmwiedemann> do we have documentation available on how to switch back to sysV permanently?
17:13:36 <LWFinger> No, this is what I was typing: "I see a new option "Default". Do you know where the control file for this is found."
17:14:08 <HolgiDE> not sure
17:14:37 <LWFinger> This subject is something for the release notes.
17:14:59 <bmwiedemann> right
17:17:11 <bmwiedemann> google turns up something about gfxboot --change-config boot:init=...
17:19:45 <bmwiedemann> what else?
17:20:24 <LWFinger> I did not find any likely candidates with "grep -r systemd /etc/*".
17:20:48 <bmwiedemann> according to bnc#723041 this should do: zypper in sysvinit-init
17:22:56 <bmwiedemann> because the /sbin/init symlink is used by default. easy enough mechanism
17:23:17 <LWFinger> That looks promising. My system has systemdinit and systemd-sysvinit.
17:24:50 <bmwiedemann> bugfixes for RC2 should be checked in this Friday. So any bug not reported soon, will stay in
17:25:03 <LWFinger> note: /sbin/init is a link to /bin/systemd.
17:25:34 <LWFinger> I will report the deadline on the Forum.
17:26:38 <bmwiedemann> openQA still showed an xorg crash - but it only occurred sometimes and only after install finished, so people can just do a reset to make the installed system boot up
17:27:55 <Holgi> I had a wired status after installation
17:28:00 <Holgi> I changed to console
17:28:08 <Holgi> and every key was printed twice
17:28:17 <Holgi> but since it was gone after reboot
17:29:17 <bmwiedemann> strange indeed.
17:29:25 <LWFinger> The Forum reports lots of problems with DVD installation. I never use the DVD and cannot confirm.
17:29:40 <Holgi> bmwiedemann: it was a LXDE installation
17:30:06 <Holgi> bmwiedemann: did you test 379 on openqa with LXDE already?
17:30:09 <bmwiedemann> LWFinger: there was a bug left in that caused software selection to crash whole yast
17:30:30 <Holgi> I also ran into that
17:30:38 <LWFinger> Is that fixed?
17:30:42 <bmwiedemann> yes. lxde looked OK on openQA
17:31:05 <Holgi> I mean, you are changen to console as well during a openqa test run
17:31:07 <bmwiedemann> should be fixed. as I understood the bugreport, it was an incomplete rebuild
17:31:17 <Holgi> did you see something similar to my problem?
17:31:20 <bmwiedemann> no
17:31:40 <LWFinger> One other problem with my system - Thunderbird crashes on its initial run, but is OK the second time.
17:31:42 <Holgi> ok, then maybe a nouveau issue
17:31:58 <bmwiedemann> e.g. http://openqa.opensuse.org/viewimg/opensuse/testresults/openSUSE-DVD-i586-Build0379-lxde/logpackages-1.png
17:32:59 <bmwiedemann> if only your keystrokes were printed twice, it could also be an input dev problem
17:35:13 <Holgi> ok
17:37:13 <bmwiedemann> then we need to set a date for next meeting
17:37:53 <Holgi> when is rc2 release planed?
17:38:30 <Holgi> november, 3rd
17:39:14 <bmwiedemann> next week. so shall we meet the monday after it?
17:39:29 <bmwiedemann> 2011-11-07
17:39:40 <LWFinger> OK here.
17:39:59 <Holgi> bmwiedemann: do you think we will make 03.11. with rc2 ?
17:40:13 <Holgi> bmwiedemann: if yes 2011-11-07 seem to be good
17:41:19 <bmwiedemann> we could still re-schedule the meeting, when it is delayed
17:41:34 <LWFinger> Wiht 12.1 no longer in Factory, the chances of a release killer should be minimized.
17:42:17 <bmwiedemann> it also means that many factory users will no more be testing the same thing as 12.1
17:43:13 <LWFinger> I posted on the Beta Forum that they should switch to 12.1 repos. I hope they did.
17:44:24 <bmwiedemann> I think, the download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.1/repo s will only have RCs - the current development state is in yet another place
17:44:51 <bmwiedemann> which I still need to find for openQA to test it :)
17:45:32 <LWFinger> Please post that on the Testing ML, when you find it.
17:47:00 <bmwiedemann> OK, I will
17:48:49 <LWFinger> I understood Coolo to say that he would cherry-pick new stuff in Factory and put it in the 12.1 repos, but I probably misinterpreted.
17:50:12 <bmwiedemann> this is what he will do. but that is a 12.1 OBS project
17:50:28 <bmwiedemann> and maybe not an FTP tree suitable for zypper or install
17:50:37 <bmwiedemann> not sure
17:51:27 <LWFinger> Does a rolling update from RC1 to RC2 make sense to you? It does to me.
17:52:26 <bmwiedemann> it might need zypper dup (did for 11.4 as some versions were downgraded then)
17:52:48 <bmwiedemann> and yes, could be helpful
17:52:53 <bmwiedemann> more / easier testing
17:53:19 <LWFinger> I will be interested in what Coolo has to say.
17:54:32 <bmwiedemann> can ask tomorrow and email to testing ML
17:54:40 <LWFinger> Thanks.
17:56:28 <bmwiedemann> anything else to discuss?
17:56:48 <LWFinger> No.
17:58:39 <bmwiedemann> Then I will close today's meeting. Thanks everyone for attending. I will add lin
17:58:39 <bmwiedemann> ks to the logs on http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting
