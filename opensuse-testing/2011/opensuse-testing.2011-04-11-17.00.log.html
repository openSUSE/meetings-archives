<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">17:01:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> Hello everyone
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">17:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> As always, today's agenda is on http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">17:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> You can still add to the agenda on the wiki while the meeting is in progress
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">17:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> hi
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">17:01:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Hi.
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">17:02:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Review Open-Bugs Day</span>
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">17:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> Well - we were way to few people this time
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">17:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> still, quite a number of updates.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">17:05:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> oh yes - and even if we got some "flak" about closing bugs as obsolete it was a good round
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">17:05:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but re-testing on current versions would be good
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">17:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I still think closing them was the right thing to do.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">17:06:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> it's just one person complaining
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">17:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> because just blindly closing anything is as nearly good as ignoring all the old stuff
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">17:06:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> in many cases its not even possible
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">17:07:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> If a bug hasn't been touched since 2007 or 8, then it is not viable.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">17:07:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> have anyone seen any of the bugs closed get reopend?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">17:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> and if reopend did the bug get moved to a current target?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">17:07:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> not mine. but I moved some of them to 11.4/5
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">17:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I pushed the wrong button and may have missed something, but a few bugs were reopened.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">17:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> I haven't seen any of mine reopend either - and from my quick scan of the bugs@os list it can't have been many
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">17:10:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> In my view its better to close a bug to many than letting them bitrot
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">17:10:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> it has potential to driver bug-reporters away
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">17:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and miss bugs that are still in there
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">17:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> I agree. The ones that were reopened were switched to 11.4 as they should have been.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">17:12:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Is closing an obsolete bug any worse than ignoring it?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">17:12:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> ok - how about a comprimize - if the "tester" is unable to test the bug on his/her system  - set the bug to needinfo -&gt; to the original reporter - no comment in 30 days after bugday close it
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">17:13:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> would be very good
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">17:13:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I did run into a number of bugs where the needinfo request was two years old!
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">17:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> I recomend entomologist for everyone as a tool to follow up on bugs
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">17:14:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LWFinger:</span> in those cases - close it
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">17:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> just closing everything could be done by a script, so we would not need an Open-Bugs-Day for that
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">17:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> I did.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">17:15:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> good
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">17:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> the bugdaytool - I kinda felt it kept sending the same bugs my way - bug? :-)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">17:17:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> http://tinyurl.com/392jnb - take a look here - there is still a few bugs from 10.0 and 10.1 left
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">17:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> it is designed to be simple and to work with 100+bugs. so it does not work well when you use the new filter feature
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">17:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> I was able to close the last 4 from opensuse 10.2 yesterday, but we should make an effort to close the remaing ones
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">17:19:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> btw - what should we do with enhancments bugs? - I often was unsure if the bug were fixed or not
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">17:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> moving to features.o.o might be an option
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">17:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> just move the bugs in such cases, and hope that the asignee ( or list) that gets it sees if its fixed or not?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">17:20:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> in fact - feature requests needs to be created out of them if they are not implemented yet
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">17:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but the questions is if this does make sense for really old bugs
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">17:21:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> should we do that? - what if the requester has long gone away / dead / distrochange
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">17:22:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I'd look if it seems still to be a useful feature
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">17:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I would not do this for enhancement bugs prior to 11.3
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">17:23:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> IMHO missing features don't magically vanish like bugs
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">17:23:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so there are plenty &gt;2 year old good ones
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">17:24:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> But they still need to be kicked one way or another.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">17:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">17:26:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> With the 10.X enhancement requests, I said "If still needed, take it to openFATE".
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">17:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> if people know where to find that?
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">17:26:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I would consider it much more important to push enhancement bugs of 11.3 and 11.4 to fate if they are not there or implemented yet
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">17:27:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> I for one don't feel like making req at openfate for other people
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">17:27:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> OK. having your name there as "Requester" might not be right.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">17:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Agreed.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">17:28:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but linking to https://features.opensuse.org/ might be good
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">17:28:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> indeed
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">17:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but you should mention "...from bug report #123456"
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">17:29:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Holgi:</span> we should have a wiki page describing that procedure
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">17:29:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> do you think that
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">17:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">17:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> there are 163 open enhancement bugs for 11.3+
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">17:30:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">17:31:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> the wiki page could describe why openFATE is better to track those, too
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">17:32:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so we only need to link there
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">17:32:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I agree
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">17:32:41 </span><span class="nka">* iznogood</span> <span class="ac">hides from AI to create a wiki</span>
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">17:34:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> shall we move to the next topic?
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">17:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> I want to mention
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">17:34:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> that we need to do more advertising of such an event next time
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">17:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> news.opesuse.org, opensuse-announcement@os.o etc.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">17:35:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> how about sending out an ical with the mail aswell - easy import into calender
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">17:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> just the date in the calendar is not enough
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">17:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we did for the first one - which might be why there were more people
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">17:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> attachments are not liked. but URLs should work.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">17:36:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Saturday is bad for the Newsletter as if comes out late on that day.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">17:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> just what I think - no bashing at all
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">17:37:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> it went wll from my point of view since it was for the first time
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">17:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> so better plan a Sunday next time?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">17:37:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> so we learned that saturdays are out
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">17:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I think so.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">17:37:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> but even if we "start" on sunday, how about opening the bugday tool on friday already
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">17:38:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">17:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">17:39:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Next topic?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">17:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> the detailed roadmap for 12.1 is not yet there, so we don't know yet when the last Milestone (MS6?) will be out.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">17:40:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we will schedule that bugsquashing later then.

<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">17:40:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> This one is mine.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">17:41:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I thought the best thing about our cycle was openQA.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">17:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">17:41:57 </span><span class="nka">* iznogood</span> <span class="ac">had  2 whole weeks on 11.4 before returning to factory, so I can't input much here</span>
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">17:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> You deserve much credit. The worst thing was that we still got bugs added betweem RC2 and GM.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">17:42:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I wonder how many people used factory-tested
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">17:43:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> apart from me
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">17:43:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> Ping someone from obs-chan, they might be able to pull out download stats
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">17:43:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I uploaded the RC2.1 to have it better tested before GM
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">17:43:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I did. On this point, 11.4 was better than 11.3 where networking was broken. The forums are still dealing with that.
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">17:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I guess my question is "How do we get more time between the last RC and GM?"
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">17:45:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> if we want a (close to) bugfree release we need more testing before the last milestones
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">17:46:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> ie - all blocker bugs should be fixed before last milestone / or at least before rc1
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">17:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> I talked to coolo about more/longer freeze and he said that it could make people move to Factory instead of stabilizing the current release
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">17:47:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and that people wanting a solid openSUSE could use the 11.3+updates which has seen 8 months of intense testing+bugfixing
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">17:48:20 </span><span class="nka">* iznogood</span> <span class="ac">thinks factory has been more or less stable last year atleast</span>
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">17:48:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Of course, there are some things that cannot even be tested with milestones if you need Packman support.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">17:48:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> packman has a essential repo for codecs now - that helps a lot
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">17:49:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> doesn't packman build for milestones?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">17:49:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> Are those release agnostic?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">17:49:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> no not totally - it lags somewhat behind
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">17:49:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> I don't think so.

<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:01:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> I use the (gnome?) mixer with lxde
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:01:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> tired to set all accordingly, but not able to change
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> but I did not create a bug report as well
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> so far
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> ok - lets look into this after the meeting
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:02:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> any other opinions on 11.4
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:02:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> it's my work station at work - I'm at home now
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:02:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Holgi:</span> an other time then
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> so no way to debaug now
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:02:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Holgi&gt;</span> debug
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:04:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> I'll repeat : any other opinions on 11.4
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:04:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> bettern 11.3, not bettern 11.2
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:04:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> so a-865 whats broken for you out of the box?
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> ie - what did we miss as in bugs for that release?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:05:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> bug 584493
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> same as 11.3
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:06:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> and the parallel boot thing
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> stock kernel will not cause init 0 to complete on old Piii
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:07:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> just sits there after umounting everything
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> and it work with non-parallel boot?
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:08:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Can that be changed from the GRUP options line?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> s/GRUP/GRUB/
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:09:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> bug 683476
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:09:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> I don't think so
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:09:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> bug 675793
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> oops, I meant bug 675370
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> bug 674919
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> parallel boot here bug 665720
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> KMS is certainly a problem. For me, the one machine that uses i915 is OK, but all my nVidia cards are broken in 2.6.37 - some fixed in 2.6.38.
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:13:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> KMS is why I refuse to suggest 11.3 to anyone
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> someone reported graphics problems with a Lenovo notebook
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:13:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> was much too green at release time
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> green=immature
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> "nomodeset" is not that hard to put in the GRUB line.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:14:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Those devs have a really tough job.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> nomodeset disables intel driver
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> unless maybe it shifts to intellegacy driver
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes - it reverts to the framebuffer driver - just like 11.2.
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:15:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> framebuffer limited to 1024x768, right?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:16:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> so nomodeset is no option here
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> No. I'm using the nv version at 1280x800 - the native res for my screen.
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> 665720 had been duped, but werner reopened it
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> now I have to figure out how to respond
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;a-865&gt;</span> big time consumer
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:20:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> that reminds me: anyone else having problems to play an .ogv in firefox4? it seems to only fail on one of my machines.
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:22:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> link to test?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> I just tested on openQA. Worked fine.
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:22:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> <span class="hi">iznogood:</span> http://openqa.opensuse.org/ has one on the lower part
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bmwiedemann:</span> works here
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> OK. then my install is somehow borked
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:25:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> btw - yast says your password is to simple for the testmaschine
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:26:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> yep. it is "nots3cr3t"
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> but does not really matter as KVM there runs in NAT mode - not reachable from outside
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:27:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> That one doesn't look that simple to me. It must be that all the letters are lower case.
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:28:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> it is also that it contains a dictionary word
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:30:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> But the topic at hand - a-865 had some bugs that did not get fixed in time, but there is an assingned person looking into the bugs atleast. - Do we have more to discuss, or should we call it quits for this one?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:30:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> we need to schedule next meeting
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:31:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> + one month - isn't that good enoght?
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:32:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Certainly no sooner than that.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> If we have milestone 1 we should have one right after ?
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:33:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:33:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> 2011-05-09 might work then?
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LWFinger&gt;</span> OK.
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:34:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iznogood&gt;</span> Sure - Is the timeslot ok for everyone? - ie noone that needs to get up in the middle of the night to attend?
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:34:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bmwiedemann&gt;</span> roughly two months after 11.4
