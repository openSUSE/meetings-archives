13:45:59 <metalgod> welcome to the GNOME team meeting
13:46:02 <bittin> thanks
13:46:03 <metalgod> first topic
13:46:17 <metalgod> #topic Feature/Future plans for openSUSE 11.4 (vuntz)
13:46:59 <metalgod> ok so let's discuss Feature/Future plans for 11.4
13:47:10 <metalgod> vuntz: what we have done right now ?
13:47:38 <vuntz> soo
13:48:01 <vuntz> this is tracked at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_features
13:48:34 <vuntz> since last meeting, I'm not sure we got a lot of changes
13:48:39 <vuntz> we got rid of hal by default
13:49:09 <vuntz> and we kept updating a few components for gnome-shell, to make it easier to do the gnome 3 spin later on
13:49:11 <metalgod> you are working on suseconfig too afaik
13:49:28 <vuntz> not much progress there
13:49:39 <vuntz> I need to fix the rpmlint checks I introduced and the rpm macros
13:50:09 <vuntz> but if you look at the suseconfig things that are left in openSUSE for GNOME, it's only desktop-file-utils and glib2
13:50:16 <vuntz> we got rid of gdm and gtk
13:50:18 <metalgod> ok... i think this is really an important feature so we can maintain some compatibility with fedora/mandriva rpm's
13:50:35 <vuntz> so yeah, it's moving a bit slowly
13:50:40 <metalgod> ok
13:50:47 <metalgod> so what about GNOME 3.0 repository ?
13:51:10 <metalgod> afaik it's going to G:Unstable
13:51:12 <vuntz> I think it's worth mentioning that for this cycle, our two big focus are new packages and cleanup of old packages. Since we'll have an old gnome for the release, new features are not necessarily something easy to do
13:51:24 <vuntz> metalgod: we don't have a repo yet
13:51:32 <vuntz> I think we can start putting stuff in G:U, indeed
13:51:45 <vuntz> so if anybody wants to update packages to 3.0, they're welcome to submit them to G:U
13:51:53 <fcrozat> (and I need to restart my GNOME shell GIT stuff)
13:52:03 <vuntz> now that we got 2.32.1 in, we should have no big updates anymore, so we can have time to work on this
13:52:04 <peter_xos> x ready
13:52:06 <peter_xos> er
13:52:15 <vuntz> DimStar: am I missing anything?
13:52:19 <metalgod> fcrozat: can you submit some of your gnome-shell work to G:U ?
13:52:21 * peter_xos has gimp 2.7.x ready in home:mrdocs
13:52:24 <DimStar> I think that's summing it up.
13:52:25 <psankar> vuntz, new packages list is available at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_new_packages ?
13:52:44 <fcrozat> metalgod: I need to resync with with git. And I'll push needed one to G:U
13:52:57 <metalgod> fcrozat: awesome... thanks
13:53:34 <bittin> Replace gnomesu by something more modern: me votes for gksu-polkit
13:53:35 <metalgod> ok
13:53:38 <vuntz> psankar: yes
13:53:52 <vuntz> bittin: yeah, that's the plan, but we need to chat with the security team
13:54:02 <vuntz> bittin: I started this but didn't get much answer from them
13:54:06 <metalgod> /me just updated the http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_features page wrt HAL removal
13:54:11 <bittin> ah ok
13:54:11 <vuntz> bittin: or, actually
13:54:20 <vuntz> bittin: the plan is to move to pkexec
13:54:26 <vuntz> (gksu-polkit was the old plan :-))
13:54:27 <bittin> ah
13:54:39 <vuntz> if anybody wants to help with that, I have a list of things to fix
13:54:41 <bittin> i guess thats fine to :)
13:54:46 <psankar> metalgod, you may note that discussion with security team as an AI ?
13:55:10 <metalgod> psankar: why not ? you and vuntz ?
13:55:19 <psankar> metalgod, sure
13:55:49 <metalgod> #action psankar Talk with the security team about gnomesu replacement for Yast
13:56:04 <metalgod> #action vuntz Talk with the security team about gnomesu replacement for Yast
13:56:17 <metalgod> soooo let's move to the next topic
13:56:25 <psankar> vuntz, I wikk take that and relieve you for the rest :-)
13:56:30 <psankar> *will
13:56:39 <metalgod> #topic openSUSE Conference and Project Update (vuntz, Captain Magnus, Dimstar)
13:57:02 <vuntz> psankar: heh
13:57:06 <metalgod> so this is the first meeting after the conference
13:57:36 <psankar> I saw not many pictures of our openSUSE GNOME team from the conference. So any pictures ? and also anything to convey from the conference ?
13:57:54 <metalgod> vuntz: captain_magnus and DimStar or anyone i'm missing (sorry) that were at the conference can you please summarize what happened at the conference ?
13:58:09 <psankar> from a GNOME perspective that is.
13:58:15 <metalgod> happy moments, coding momentsm anything you like to add
13:58:31 <vuntz> unfortunately, captain_magnus couldn't make it :/
13:58:37 <bittin> i was not there as its expansive to go from Sweden, might go some other time tough
13:58:37 <vuntz> so, what happened...
13:58:38 <vuntz> hrm
13:58:43 <psankar> :(
13:58:46 * vuntz looks at DimStar ;-)
13:58:56 <psankar> no icecream deathmatch ?
13:59:05 <DimStar> vuntz: hmm... I think the most note-worthy was the discussion with 'legal' for the codec installer / search
13:59:27 <vuntz> right
13:59:36 <vuntz> want to summarize it? Or want me to do it?
13:59:47 <DimStar> you have the niceer accent :)
13:59:49 <metalgod> vuntz: summarize please
14:00:28 <vuntz> we had a long  chat with the legal team during the party
14:00:47 <vuntz> we explained what we can do (from a technical pov) and they explained what we can't do (from a legal pov)
14:01:09 <vuntz> we kind of found a middle-ground that would make installation of codecs easier
14:01:42 <vuntz> that need some work in gnome-packagekit, as well as a search engine for packages that can answer queries like "whatprovides"
14:02:46 <vuntz> don't really want to enter in all the details here
14:02:57 <vuntz> I guess I should really just write the summary of the discussion to the mailing list
14:03:04 <psankar> okay
14:03:09 <metalgod> fine
14:03:09 <vuntz> I don't think we can implement all this for 11.4, though
14:03:20 <psankar> anything came from the KDE folks ?
14:03:22 <vuntz> looks like we're a bit short in time
14:03:34 <vuntz> they weren't able to join the discussion, iirc
14:03:38 <psankar> okay
14:04:08 <vuntz> but since it's really gstreamer-centric, I'm not sure it would work well for kde
14:04:15 <psankar> okay okay
14:04:28 <metalgod> vuntz: there was a big GNOME representation at the conference ?
14:04:56 <vuntz> it was okay
14:05:16 <psankar> did anyone from SLED team came ?
14:05:44 <metalgod> psankar: sreeves_out i think
14:05:58 <psankar> ah yes. saw a talk by him on pulseaudio iirc
14:06:00 <metalgod> he talked about PA
14:06:00 <DimStar> yes, sreeves was there.
14:06:10 <metalgod> ok
14:06:12 <psankar> i think we cna move to next.
14:06:13 <vuntz> (sorry, keyboard break :-))
14:06:22 <metalgod> next topic
14:06:34 <metalgod> #topic Bugday plans or Updates (Should call Alexander ? Vuntz)
14:06:49 <metalgod> psankar: i'm going to remove the topic about meeting minutes
14:06:55 <metalgod> we'll talk later
14:06:57 <vuntz> bug day plans
14:06:59 <psankar> metalgod, ah okay
14:06:59 <vuntz> easy
14:07:06 <vuntz> on saturday, we do a bug day about old bugs
14:07:13 <vuntz> from 10.2 to 11.0
14:07:21 <vuntz> if people want to help, please join #opensuse-bugs
14:07:31 <psankar> neat
14:07:33 <vuntz> I know we have tons of old GNOME Bugs, so help welcome
14:07:42 <metalgod> vuntz: mostly closing market /obsolete/fixed/needinfo
14:07:44 <metalgod> ?
14:07:50 <psankar> and upstream ?
14:08:10 <vuntz> yes
14:08:17 <vuntz> it's mostly obsolete/fixed
14:08:24 <psankar> okay
14:08:26 <vuntz> or if bug is still valid, forward upstream and close as upstream
14:08:37 <metalgod> perfect
14:08:53 <metalgod> i wonder if someone can write a guideline for new contributors to help
14:08:55 <metalgod> would be nice
14:09:02 <vuntz> that's something I want to do tomorrow
14:09:06 <vuntz> we need doc for the bug day
14:09:49 <metalgod> ok
14:09:50 <metalgod> next topic
14:09:56 <bittin> :) i can translate doc to swedish
14:09:59 <bittin> if needed
14:10:08 <metalgod> #topic Any updates or call-for-help from Meego camp ? (FunkyPenguin, fcrozat)
14:10:09 <bittin> next
14:10:42 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: fcrozat soooo how goes meego ?
14:11:12 <fcrozat> I can't comment on smeegol, sorry
14:11:29 <fcrozat> (ie I don't follow it)
14:11:36 <psankar> I think we can skip it.
14:12:01 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: around ?
14:12:12 <FunkyPenguin> ooh is it meeting time already
14:12:14 <bittin> smeegol seems cool but i haven't touched it yet
14:12:14 <FunkyPenguin> sorry
14:12:22 <bittin> FunkyPenguin it seems so :p
14:12:23 <FunkyPenguin> metalgod, yes ive got an update
14:12:29 <psankar> ah good
14:12:37 <FunkyPenguin> ok i've started to get things updated to 1.1
14:12:47 <FunkyPenguin> almost there
14:13:25 <FunkyPenguin> i need to redo the icon theme as intel re-licensed it from CCBYSA to proprietary :(
14:13:38 <FunkyPenguin> thankfully hbons has given me what i need to do so
14:13:42 <DimStar> can't you take the set as before it was relicnesed :)
14:14:06 <FunkyPenguin> well as it happens i thought i had for 1.0, but have been corrected ;)
14:14:25 <psankar> FunkyPenguin, we cant make noise about it ? and make them reopen it ?
14:14:36 <FunkyPenguin> DimStar, basically that is what im going to do, but i want to add the yast specific icons to the source properly
14:14:40 <fcrozat> psankar: I wouldn't expect a change from them
14:14:47 <psankar> fcrozat, oh okay.
14:14:55 <fcrozat> intel wants to protect MeeGo brand
14:15:02 <psankar> hrmmm.
14:15:09 <fcrozat> and usage of the icon theme is limited to MeeGo compliannce
14:15:19 * psankar jopes meego doesnt follow the footsteps of iFolder
14:15:22 <psankar> *hopes
14:15:34 <FunkyPenguin> as far as packaging goes 32bit builds almost fine, 64bit needs some patches
14:15:38 <metalgod> psankar: at least ifolder got open sourced again
14:15:47 <psankar> metalgod, no comments.
14:15:54 <metalgod> eheh
14:15:56 <metalgod> ok
14:16:04 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: any call for help »?
14:16:42 <FunkyPenguin> err yeah - if folk can help fix the packaging of the handful of packages that would be great - about 6 in total
14:17:03 <FunkyPenguin> my next issue is how to go about reorganising the repos
14:17:22 * metalgod tries to get a netbook to help FunkyPenguin
14:17:39 <FunkyPenguin> im not convinced that smeegol/meego will make it into the core distro as it depends heavily on chromium
14:18:06 <FunkyPenguin> but if i can get someone to help get firefox supported in the same way then we have a chance
14:18:18 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: can you explain better ?
14:18:28 <FunkyPenguin> i spoke to wolfiR about it at the conference, and he doesnt have any time etc
14:19:06 <FunkyPenguin> metalgod, basically chromium is the default browser, and it integrates with the web panel app
14:19:09 <fcrozat> hmm, only the internet tab on meego is depending on chromium IIRC
14:19:13 <psankar> i believe there may be someone in SLED for firefox (/me once applied for that post). so pinging sshaw or sreeves_out may give some help
14:19:39 <FunkyPenguin> fcrozat, correct but that is part of the experience
14:19:55 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: so what's wrong in putting chromium in core ?
14:19:57 <FunkyPenguin> psankar, i think bgmerril is the man youre thinking of
14:20:03 <wolfiR> hrosik (Petr Cerny) is more or less responsible for internal stuff
14:20:09 <psankar> FunkyPenguin, okay.
14:20:20 <FunkyPenguin> chromium is too fast a moving target
14:20:24 <wolfiR> bgmerrel has left Novell months ago
14:20:34 <FunkyPenguin> oh really?
14:21:02 <FunkyPenguin> i wonder if jpr can advise then
14:21:15 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: but can't someone select a chromium release from 8.0 (beta) to add to the core ?
14:21:19 <metalgod> i don't see any problem
14:21:38 <FunkyPenguin> maybe, will need to speak to prusnak & tittiatcoke
14:21:45 <FunkyPenguin> they look after it in contrib
14:21:47 <wolfiR> FunkyPenguin: would be nice if you could write up some kind of specification
14:21:53 * prusnak here
14:22:06 <FunkyPenguin> wolfiR, ok i'll try
14:22:27 <FunkyPenguin> wolfiR, i didnt meant to make it sound like you were dismissing me
14:22:31 <FunkyPenguin> i know you're busy
14:22:46 <FunkyPenguin> so basically to sum up the smeegol update...
14:22:55 <wolfiR> it actually doesn't sound like a very easy task, and that's where the time constraints come in
14:23:10 <FunkyPenguin> ... im hoping to release 1.1 by the end of the year
14:23:46 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: anything you want to add more to this topic ?
14:23:49 <FunkyPenguin> vuntz, would it be possible to rename smeegol to gnome netbook?
14:23:57 <vuntz> FunkyPenguin: hrm
14:24:02 <FunkyPenguin> or NetbookGNOME ?
14:24:02 <metalgod> FunkyPenguin: gnome-netbook ?
14:24:04 <vuntz> FunkyPenguin: don't know
14:24:10 <fcrozat> why GNOME ?
14:24:20 <metalgod> i'm not sure if meego as anything to do with GNOME
14:24:34 <metalgod> even more with them porting apps to Qt
14:24:49 <bittin> i think smeegol is a great name
14:24:52 <prusnak> FunkyPenguin: if you are forced to change Smeegol name I would go back to Goblin
14:24:55 <psankar> +1
14:25:00 <bittin> +1
14:25:01 <prusnak> but otherwise i would stick to Smeegol
14:25:04 <FunkyPenguin> yeah ok
14:25:11 <FunkyPenguin> i was just thinking out loud
14:25:35 <metalgod> goblin is nice
14:25:42 <FunkyPenguin> well im still waiting on the LinuxFoundation, Intel & Nokia to respond to my questions
14:25:44 <metalgod> or openSUSEgo
14:26:17 <psankar> metalgod, '$ME'go ;-) ? (bad joke) I think we can move to next.
14:26:45 <metalgod> psankar: ouch it reminded me perl
14:26:47 <metalgod> ok
14:26:49 <metalgod> people
14:26:50 <metalgod> next topic
14:27:12 <metalgod> #topic Packaging needs for 11.4 (everyone)
14:27:29 <psankar> i think vuntz covered it in the previous url. so we can skip it.
14:27:34 <metalgod> so for 11.4 we have a focus that is adding more GNOME/Gtk applications
14:27:36 <metalgod> to this topic
14:27:41 <metalgod> errr
14:27:51 <psankar> please contribute packages in  : http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_new_packages
14:27:59 <metalgod> so if someone have a application request please add it to this page ^
14:28:04 <metalgod> thanks psankar
14:28:13 <vuntz> hrm
14:28:20 <vuntz> please don't add application request to the page
14:28:28 <vuntz> send a mail to opensuse-gnome or tell it here
14:28:38 <metalgod> hmm yes actually sound better
14:28:38 <psankar> okay
14:28:43 <metalgod> so we don't get the page spammed
14:28:51 <vuntz> I've a huge list of application requests, and I'm slowly updating the wiki page to make sure we don't have too many at once
14:29:15 <bittin> gnome-mplayer ?
14:29:19 <metalgod> i think a nice step we can do it to integrate gtk bindings
14:29:30 <metalgod> like ruby that DimStar did
14:29:32 <bittin> also a +1 for smuxi
14:29:43 <metalgod> bittin: smuxi is on Mono repo
14:30:00 <bittin> ah was on that site so i thinked but
14:30:30 <psankar> metalgod, do you think we can ask someone from mono team to submit it under GNOME  ?
14:30:31 <metalgod> gnome-mplayer should stay on packmann
14:30:44 <metalgod> psankar: i don't see a problem
14:31:03 <psankar> okay.
14:31:14 <metalgod> asking ajorg if he can SR smuxi to G:A
14:31:36 <metalgod> #action psankar ask ajorg (mono team) if someone can SR smuxi to G:Apps
14:31:38 <bittin> i don't know all application rules and can zypper install so maybe i should just keep silent
14:31:46 <psankar> neat
14:32:17 <metalgod> bittin: no please say... we are happy to hear your opinions
14:32:21 <vuntz> note that it's fine if smuxi stays in M:C, as long as it's maintained :-)
14:32:59 <metalgod> ok
14:33:00 <psankar> okay. but not many people may have M:C in the lsit of default repositories which is why I thought so.
14:33:00 <metalgod> next topic
14:33:19 <metalgod> #action Feedback/Issues with 11.4 milestone builds
14:33:28 <metalgod> i think we can skip this topic
14:33:32 <vuntz> well
14:33:46 <vuntz> I'd love to hear about the big issues people have with GNOME in the milestones
14:34:07 <vuntz> since this indicates what we should fix :-)
14:34:10 <psankar> I had one issue. but not sure if it is still happening. empathy was crashing when somoen nearby pinged me
14:34:17 * metalgod have migrated to Factory yet
14:34:20 <psankar> i will check with the latest build and will update
14:35:47 <psankar> metalgod, i think we can move on.
14:35:50 <metalgod> ok
14:35:52 <metalgod> next topic
14:35:59 <metalgod> #action Q & A
14:36:01 <metalgod> errr
14:36:04 <psankar> i have one question
14:36:05 <metalgod> #topic Q & A
14:36:09 <metalgod> shoot psankar
14:36:34 <psankar> It isn't GNOME specific. What happened to the new booster position ? will it be filled ?
14:37:08 <vuntz> yeah
14:37:15 <metalgod> psankar: maybe you should ask Klaas about it
14:37:33 <psankar> okay :-)
14:37:52 <metalgod> ok this isn't really a question is more a topic
14:37:59 <metalgod> it's about 11.3 updates
14:38:09 <metalgod> i've been dealing with a few
14:38:29 <metalgod> and i would like if anyone feels that their 11.3 system breaks with anyhting
14:38:38 <metalgod> a msn protocol or a gtalk change
14:38:44 <metalgod> please open a bug and ping me
14:38:55 <psankar> I had icq breakage but that was bcos of the server
14:38:57 <metalgod> i think it's really important for us to have a functional stable release
14:39:13 <psankar> and tehn  onwards we need to use icq without ssl :(
14:39:15 <metalgod> same for gwibber and twitter (in my TODO)
14:39:23 <metalgod> psankar: please open a bug
14:39:34 <metalgod> i guess we can try to get pidgin 2.6.7 in 11.3
14:39:35 <psankar> metalgod, there is a bug already open by _Marcus_
14:39:41 <metalgod> fixes most of those issues
14:40:02 <psankar> we may need to check if the kopete guys have found  a way for icq to work with ssl
14:40:07 <bittin> can this be to any help?: http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/MSNCertIssue
14:40:15 <psankar> and if it there is a way we need to fix pidgin as well
14:40:17 <vuntz> metalgod: want to take care of the pidgin bugs?
14:40:28 <metalgod> bittin: according to pidgin upstream it's fixed on 2.6.7
14:40:42 <metalgod> vuntz: yes i'm talking a few bugs that got things broken on 11.3
14:41:01 <metalgod> s/talking/taking
14:41:01 <vuntz> metalgod: bug 655477 and bug 655675
14:41:07 <bugbot> openSUSE bug 655477 in openSUSE 11.4 (GNOME) "pidgin: unable to validate MSN certificate" [Normal,New] https://bugzilla.novell.com/655477
14:41:09 <bugbot> openSUSE bug 655675 in openSUSE 11.2 (GNOME) "pidgin 2.6.6 ICQ broken" [Major,Needinfo] https://bugzilla.novell.com/655675
14:41:21 <metalgod> vuntz: yes i'll try to get 2.6.7 in updates for 11.3
14:41:26 <vuntz> metalgod: feel free to go ahead there
14:41:32 <metalgod> it's best than backport the fixes
14:41:41 <DimStar> Pidgin 2.7.7 completely fixes the MSN certificate issue, enables multiple MSN logins, and fixes the AIM SSL Handshake Failure error.
14:41:46 <DimStar> (from the pidgin.im website)
14:41:54 <metalgod> DimStar: i'm following the bug upstream
