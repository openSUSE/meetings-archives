14:06:34 <AJaeger> Let's give it a try again.
14:06:36 <AJaeger> Thanks suseROCKs!
14:06:42 <AJaeger> welcome everybody to this weeks 12.1 check-in meeting
14:07:02 <AJaeger> Launch of 12.1 is in two weeks and Coolo is on track with the release of RC2 tomorrow.
14:07:18 <AJaeger> But we do not have medias yet, so it might be late tomorrow...
14:07:29 <AJaeger> #chair jospoortvliet suseROCKs
14:07:29 <bugbot> Current chairs: AJaeger jospoortvliet suseROCKs
14:07:53 <AJaeger> Let's go through the launch check list at http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_Checklist
14:08:03 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet, will you take the first item?
14:08:09 <AJaeger> #topic Marketing Activities
14:08:15 <suseROCKs> I suggest you post the announcement on Friday so that most of the mirrors are populated by then and people don't wonder why they reach deadend when they try to download immediately
14:08:17 <jospoortvliet> sec
14:08:44 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: If you go through the links from the announcement, it redirects only to mirros that have it.
14:08:56 <AJaeger> And yes, we only announce once enough mirrors have it ;)
14:09:12 <suseROCKs> which usually takes about 12 hours before 5 have it
14:09:42 <jospoortvliet> Ok let's go to the status of marketing activities
14:09:52 * suseROCKs thinks as a side note we should ask in the future that releases happen on Wed so we don't get hit with sub-optimal news day (Friday) too often
14:09:52 * AJaeger edits the wiki
14:10:09 <jospoortvliet> the big, limiting thing is the product highlights/release notes
14:10:23 <jospoortvliet> It's hard to say how far we are. Quite a few ppl have helped but it's a big thing.
14:10:30 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: not easy from an engineering side - let's discuss another time.
14:10:38 <suseROCKs> yes
14:10:45 <jospoortvliet> I have planned to work on it over the weekend, that should make a difference hopefully :D
14:11:04 <jospoortvliet> Meanwhile AJ and myself are working on something cool:
14:11:23 <jospoortvliet> we intend to try and send openSUSE 12.1 DVD's together with cool goodies to the release parties worldwide.
14:11:38 <jospoortvliet> that of course depends on them being not to early , release day is obviously not possible for us to make.
14:11:48 <jospoortvliet> think 2-4 weeks after the release as reasonable date...
14:11:58 <jospoortvliet> it's part of the article about release parties which hopefully goes out today.
14:12:04 <suseROCKs> what is your tentative expected date for when DVDs will be ready for shipments?
14:12:14 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: release day, approximately
14:12:25 <suseROCKs> Good show
14:12:39 <jospoortvliet> but shipping & handling takes anywhere from 1week (germany) to 4 weeks for USA, Brazil, most of Azia etc
14:12:59 <jospoortvliet> anyway
14:13:13 <jospoortvliet> to send these things out efficiently we're trying to distribute the sending out
14:13:35 <jospoortvliet> I'm talking to ppl in South america and Asia to get them to handle the 'local' shipping
14:13:36 <suseROCKs> "distribute the sending out" meaning?
14:13:44 <suseROCKs> ah
14:13:45 <jospoortvliet> we've already got europe and USA covered.
14:13:59 <suseROCKs> that would be a good thing.  Something we've talked about for a long time
14:14:13 <jospoortvliet> however, while EU is stocked pretty OK on goodies, USA has no flyers, posters and the like and Asia and South America have nothing.
14:14:23 <jospoortvliet> so I am trying to secure some budget
14:14:27 <jospoortvliet> and let them create things
14:14:38 <jospoortvliet> part of that depends on... surprise... the flyer we've been trying to finish forever :D
14:15:03 <jospoortvliet> I took what we have now and have send it to SUSE Marketing, they will let a contracter finish it. It will hopefully be done somewhere next week.
14:15:32 <jospoortvliet> I will try to get the sources so we can translate it but 'worst case' we can send them the translations in a file and they will put 'em in
14:15:36 <jospoortvliet> then we have flyers to print
14:15:55 <jospoortvliet> next step: posters and the like. We have some, they are translatable too, so that is something I hope Kostas can help coordinate
14:16:01 <jospoortvliet> warlordfff: ^
14:16:35 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I just achieved "Gold VIP" status with my local printer and they claim huge discounts on brochure printing.    We should look into whether using them will save us some money and have some printed in US rather than shipped
14:16:37 <jospoortvliet> they can be printed too. I will make a list of what we have for Asia, Brazil and USA to pick from. In USA, I hope AlanClark will make the 'local' decisions on what's needed based on what's there
14:16:56 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: the idea is absolutely to print locally...
14:17:01 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: we only ship DVD's.
14:17:21 <jospoortvliet> same goes for things like t-shirts and other goodies: make it local.
14:17:43 <suseROCKs> ok I'll investigate the VIP pricing schedule and let you know this week if its a good deal compared to what you guys can find
14:17:47 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Local means bascially: Make it in several places.
14:17:53 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: yup
14:18:15 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: that would be: USA for some 'paper' (flyers, posters); Brazil and India/Taiwan: everything but DVD's :D
14:18:45 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   that may actually be a good thing.   Gives us the opportunity to build vendor relationships in multiple places thus levaraging some buying power in the future
14:18:55 <suseROCKs> s/levaraging/leveraging/
14:18:59 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: stop using such big words
14:19:04 <jospoortvliet> we just make stuff and give it away :D
14:19:11 <jospoortvliet> hehe
14:19:31 <jospoortvliet> anyway. that's about the release parties.
14:19:36 <jospoortvliet> in short: we hope to make them cooler than ever :D
14:19:46 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   bite my supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
14:20:09 <jospoortvliet> one thing I'm not sure about: what to do with the release parties which can't be supplied with DVD's on time. Do we send them something asap, AJaeger?
14:20:15 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: :D
14:20:36 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: I can send them something from Germany - but we don't have that much...
14:20:43 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   we need to know who will have early-on release parties and give them early release to GM.
14:20:53 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: not much, as in, does Nue need re-stocking too?
14:21:04 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yeah that's on the release party plan page :D
14:21:27 <AJaeger> We have in Nuernberg enough of what we have - but without media I'm not sure it makes really sense to send out...
14:21:48 <suseROCKs> I wouldn't send stuff out either (unless you know its a really big event)
14:22:06 <suseROCKs> People know and expect that release day parties simply have limited means
14:22:08 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: 3 t-shirts, some stickers, flyers and 2 posters are pretty cool for a release party... But it does depend on how big it's expected to be.
14:22:31 <AJaeger> That'S something I can send
14:22:46 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: yup. Let's table this for now and figure it out later, OK?
14:22:54 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Agreed
14:23:18 <jospoortvliet> ok
14:23:31 <jospoortvliet> So that's about "making the release parties cool"
14:23:44 <jospoortvliet> about the other stuff
14:23:48 <jospoortvliet> the RC2 announcement is ready to go :D
14:23:56 <jospoortvliet> I'll coordinate with Coolo about the release time.
14:24:07 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Thanks
14:24:16 <jospoortvliet> yesterday we did an article about promoting openSUSE
14:24:24 <jospoortvliet> please point ppl to it :D
14:24:35 <Ilmehtar> (and my twitter followers increased by 20%..)
14:24:41 <AJaeger> Ilmehtar: Wow!
14:24:43 <jospoortvliet> Ilmehtar: goood :D haha
14:24:45 <jospoortvliet> congrats...
14:24:49 <jospoortvliet> so that worked :D
14:25:01 <Ilmehtar> yup :)
14:25:11 <jospoortvliet> meanwhile, anditosan has worked with me and Ilmehtar on the presentations
14:25:13 <jospoortvliet> updating them
14:25:38 <jospoortvliet> As soon as the product highlights are done I will make sure we have an 12.1 overview presentation
14:25:59 <jospoortvliet> otherwise, we're done there. We've got a great template (thanks Ilmehtar and anditosan!) and presentations.
14:26:08 <Ilmehtar> I did some slides covering some gnome specific highlights
14:26:28 <jospoortvliet> Ilmehtar: yeah, I'll re-use that, tnx :D
14:26:50 <jospoortvliet> for today we publish "organize launch parties"
14:26:57 <jospoortvliet> that one is 90% ready to go
14:27:22 <jospoortvliet> unfinished parts are related to "what to do with launch parties to early for getting DVD's" and how to create nice posters
14:27:33 <jospoortvliet> I got from anditosan a nice release poster template but it's 107 MB
14:27:38 <jospoortvliet> so I need to see if that can be smaller :D
14:27:40 <jospoortvliet> hehe
14:27:56 <suseROCKs> Did Anditosan release the Party posters he was designing yet?
14:28:07 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: that's the one I'm talking about
14:28:16 <suseROCKs> ok
14:28:16 <jospoortvliet> as I said, the template is 107 MB so that's a tad big...
14:28:26 <jospoortvliet> In the writing area, see http://ietherpad.com/sked
14:28:28 <suseROCKs> yes  106 mb is the max
14:28:38 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: hehehe
14:28:53 <jospoortvliet> most important point about writing: WE NEED MOAAAR!
14:29:08 <jospoortvliet> I try to write a bit, but need help....
14:29:28 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1 will write an article about systemd and btrfs
14:29:47 <jospoortvliet> but we can use articles about the desktops (at least a GNOME and a KDE one or an all in one)
14:30:05 <jospoortvliet> and especially articles focussing on sys admins, servers and the like
14:30:07 <jospoortvliet> would be awesome
14:30:08 <suseROCKs> tigerfoot mentioned there will be some significant improvements to apparmor.   Do we have verification of that and if so, an article to go with it?
14:30:23 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: that's one of the articles which would be great to have, yes
14:30:37 <suseROCKs> so is it true that there are improvements?
14:30:42 <suseROCKs> significantly, that is.
14:30:51 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: There are major changes indeed.
14:31:36 <anditosan> Hi all!
14:31:38 <suseROCKs> So we need to find someone who knows this stuff and can write a coherent article about it.
14:31:59 <jospoortvliet> hi anditosan I've been talking about you behind your back :D
14:32:01 <suseROCKs> sorry jospoortvliet   Is "coherent" a big word?
14:32:12 <jospoortvliet> [02.11.2011 12:27] <jospoortvliet> I got from anditosan a nice release poster template but it's 107 MB
14:32:12 <anditosan> hehehe
14:32:14 <jospoortvliet> [02.11.2011 12:27] <jospoortvliet> so I need to see if that can be smaller :D
14:32:26 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes but you're forgiven...
14:32:28 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet, suseROCKs: This is mentioned on the ietherpad http://ietherpad.com/sked
14:32:35 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: yes I know
14:32:40 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   yes
14:32:44 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Ask Christian Boltz, he'S the AppArmor expert
14:33:20 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: I wanted quality :D
14:33:41 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: I did not get a chance to make the changes on the poster last night, I believe I will have time tonight
14:34:00 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: sorry, too late, have to publish in an hour or so
14:34:06 <anditosan> suseROCKs: Hey man
14:34:14 <jospoortvliet> and that file is too big for ppl to download and edit
14:34:20 <jospoortvliet> if they're not on broadband :D
14:34:23 <jospoortvliet> besides, we can't host it
14:34:24 <suseROCKs> hi anditosan
14:34:27 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: Really? mmm not sure what I could do
14:34:52 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,    just go ahead and publish the article sans the poster info  and when anditosan is ready, we have an excuse to say "Hey guys!  Cool stuff here!  Come n get it!"
14:35:00 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: I can put it in the article, a picture, and point to the wiki, but say there it'll be there soon?
14:35:12 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: yeah, that works
14:35:17 <CarlosRibeiro> jospoortvliet: openStack is such differentiator for us,  SUSE, HP, Dell and other companyes are investing on that, but not RedHat, and as result openStack will not be differentiator for next fedora release that will be lauch 2 days before 12.1, imho could be good any highlight on that topic
14:35:19 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yeah but you can't publish an entire article for just that :D I think my plan is a bit better...
14:35:30 <jospoortvliet> CarlosRibeiro: but we don't ship it in openSUSE 12.1
14:35:35 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: I just have to shrink everything, that's no problem, just don't have the time since Im at work
14:35:53 <CarlosRibeiro> jospoortvliet: ok
14:35:58 <jospoortvliet> CarlosRibeiro: sorry... it'd be awesome but we don't have it. It's in a separate repository, so we can talk about it in an article after the release.
14:36:24 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: ok, if you do it tonight, I'll put that on the wiki. we must make sure it gets hosted somewhere, however
14:36:26 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: btw I did finish updating the slideshows to 12.1
14:36:27 <jospoortvliet> not sure how to do that...
14:36:32 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: cool, mail them :D
14:36:35 <jospoortvliet> so I can put them in Git
14:36:41 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: I will
14:36:46 <jospoortvliet> question to all
14:36:58 <jospoortvliet> who knows what the link was to tigerfoot's mirror of our Git?
14:37:00 <CarlosRibeiro> jospoortvliet: great, when the time comes, I volunteer to write something about VT, that is ne of my favorities topics
14:37:12 <jospoortvliet> so we can put download links somewhere instead of forcing ppl to clone all our git?
14:37:21 <jospoortvliet> CarlosRibeiro: VT?
14:37:26 <CarlosRibeiro> virtualization
14:37:37 <jospoortvliet> CarlosRibeiro: if you want you can start writing, we can publish it the days after the openSUSE 12.1 release
14:37:53 <jospoortvliet> CarlosRibeiro: and if you can write about openstack that'd be awesome too, I would love to get something out on that - it's hot...
14:37:57 <CarlosRibeiro> jospoortvliet: right
14:38:14 <jospoortvliet> btw we will probably have owncloud in openSUSE 12.1 with YaST integration and/or desktop integration :D
14:38:16 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I don't recall it nor am I sure Bruno has maintained it,  But I would suggest we be careful to assume that and put an overload on his server of people pounding it for downloads
14:38:37 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: well we do need a place to let ppl download release party posters and the new presentations...
14:38:42 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: suggestions?
14:38:57 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   If you have an idea for the article, you can go ahead and write it now and then it gets saved to release at a later date.     We want to see more people building up a good cache of articles for future use
14:39:12 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: I can find some place with the openSUSE admins to put data up, if needed.
14:39:18 <AJaeger> But then it shouldn't change often...
14:39:25 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: and that's the problem...
14:39:30 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: ok
14:39:39 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: any chance THEY could mirror Git? Or should we simply move to github NOW :D
14:40:10 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: we have moved to github for many other projects incl. obs already.
14:40:18 <AJaeger> Moving artwork as well is not the problem...
14:40:25 <jospoortvliet> is there a GIT master here who can move our repository to GitHub, give us all access and write a 5-line how-to for the current gitorious users on how to switch their repositories?
14:40:43 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Let's ask digitltom_away
14:40:53 <Ilmehtar> its almost like we need something like Kablink.... ( http://www.sysrich.co.uk:8080 - my experimental server to demo what Kablink vibe can do)
14:41:02 <jospoortvliet> hehe Ilmehtar
14:41:02 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Best via email - tschmidt@suse
14:41:10 <jospoortvliet> Ilmehtar: does it support git or what :D
14:41:23 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: ok I will ask him
14:41:32 <jospoortvliet> suse.com or .de?
14:41:37 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: ^
14:41:38 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: .de
14:41:44 <Ilmehtar> jospoortvliet: not yet (but we can look into that) but it does support WebDAV remember..I've used it to copy most of the artwork git repo up to the server as a demo
14:42:04 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: What is the status for the rest of http://ietherpad.com/sked ?
14:42:07 <jospoortvliet> Ilmehtar: yeah but webdav doesn't keep your files offline and doesn't work when several ppl work at once etc
14:42:26 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: Most of what's in the schedule will happen.
14:42:32 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Good!
14:42:34 <jospoortvliet> it's not THAT much work...
14:42:49 <jospoortvliet> if ppl don't step in I will work nights to make at least those articles happen :D
14:42:55 <Ilmehtar> jospoortvliet: copy/paste from local to webdav works just fine :) and kablink does versioning.. (You're not totally wrong..but still..)
14:42:58 <jospoortvliet> (please, any help welcome, as I value my sleep)
14:43:05 <anditosan> joospoortvliet: yay!!!
14:43:16 <AJaeger> #info PLease help with writing article - see http://ietherpad.com/sked
14:43:17 <jospoortvliet> Ilmehtar: let's move to github first, it's closer to our current workflow - minor change is easier
14:43:19 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,    there are some people associated with some artiles in sked.  Do we have confirmations that they are still working on them or?
14:43:44 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes for manu, probably for kostas
14:44:00 <jospoortvliet> yes for terrorpup
14:44:07 <jospoortvliet> so mostly yes :D
14:44:14 <suseROCKs> ok
14:44:30 <jospoortvliet> so that's it for me, I'd say.
14:44:46 <jospoortvliet> we can move to the next agenda item, AJaeger
14:44:54 <AJaeger> #topic Social Media Activities
14:44:54 <jospoortvliet> unless there are (more) questions...
14:45:08 <AJaeger> Satmanuk is not here. anditosan will you lead through this?
14:45:31 <anditosan> I can try
14:46:19 <anditosan> All I know is that I created a poster for the release that needs to be shrink for others to use. THere was also a request to create artwork to poromote opensuse on buses which I am about to finish
14:46:54 <anditosan> we coordinated with AlanClark the printing of the materials and some minor changes. The idea is to publish the poster and use it to promote release parties all over THE WORLD!!!!
14:47:32 <anditosan> the poster should be done tomorrow, but we still need to figure out times and media that will be used in for the parties, let's say DVD"s with 12.1 in it
14:47:52 <anditosan> is there anyone in charge of creating the dvd's or will they have to wait until release?
14:48:35 <AJaeger> anditosan: DVDs production is handled by Jos and myself.
14:48:44 <AJaeger> anditosan: We hope to have it ready for release.
14:49:03 <anditosan> AJaeger: ok, that would mean that the release parties should be done shrotly after release
14:49:04 <AJaeger> What you mentioned is great but has not much todo with Social Media.
14:49:17 <AJaeger> anditosan: Yes, indeed - jospoortvliet mentioned this already before you joined ;)
14:49:25 <suseROCKs> the important thing to do on Release day (and the day after) is to get everyone to watch hashtags and retweet as much as possible.    Get the trending higher wherever possible
14:49:43 <suseROCKs> We did this well in 11.2
14:49:48 <anditosan> hehe yeah I know. There is a couple of pieces of artwork featured in the wiki that are to be used for twitter as a background.
14:49:59 <anditosan> instructions on how to use it are on the wiki as well
14:50:18 <AJaeger> anditosan: Yep, jospoortvliet wrote that in the article yesterday
14:50:24 <anditosan> I am not sure though if there is artwork to be used on sites like facebook though
14:50:32 <anditosan> do we have something like that this time?
14:50:45 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: not really. We have twibbon, about which I tweeted yesterday...
14:50:59 <jospoortvliet> http://twibbon.com/join/openSUSE-Users
14:51:03 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,  I was on the road last release with a semi broken laptop so I wasn't sure if we captured stats like we wanted to.   Did we and how did we do it?
14:51:06 <anditosan> should we create one for facebook? I could use the avatar for the buses to be used for faceboook
14:51:22 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: I don't remember anymore ;-(
14:51:34 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: that would be awesome, yes!
14:51:41 <Dominian> AJaeger: Didn't you use google analytics or something?
14:51:45 <anditosan> ok, I will make that a task then!
14:51:47 <suseROCKs> well,  for facebook, we used CarlosRibeiro's 3D Geeko which was very popular.   CarlosRibeiro   Would you like to re-create a 12.1 version?
14:51:57 <AJaeger> Dominian: for twitter?
14:51:58 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: sure
14:52:02 <Dominian> AJaeger: ohhh twitter..
14:52:04 * Dominian shups
14:52:17 <anditosan> also, there was an idea to make qr codes to be placed in some of the marketing materials, I am not sure who could create these
14:52:30 <anditosan> they could be featured in more than just posters
14:52:36 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: that will be my first contrib as my return to this awesome community
14:52:51 <suseROCKs> anditosan,   anyone can create qr codes.  The debate has alwys been about what the qr code should contain.
14:53:03 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   Awesome
14:53:13 <anditosan> suseROCKs: we thought it could be popular sites such as opensuse.org and other notable ones
14:53:19 * suseROCKs opened blender for the first time last night to try to figure out how it works
14:53:45 <anditosan> the idea in all would be to show the world our community
14:54:01 <anditosan> so links to community sites, and even irc would be good
14:54:15 <suseROCKs> anditosan,   great.   So just come up with what that list should be and create the qr code.    bear454 created a qr code with Geeko logo in it which I thought was cool.
14:54:34 <anditosan> would it be ok if we first put opensuse.org on the qr codes and I feature them in some of the materials I am working on?
14:54:36 <anditosan> nice nice
14:54:38 <anditosan> :D
14:54:55 <suseROCKs> anditosan,   what do you mean by first?
14:55:11 <anditosan> I mean the poster I created and also the avatar I am working on for the buses
14:56:04 <suseROCKs> well  from what I've seen if you create code as one link, then the code is a link url,  but if you do a list in the code, then the code is a text list.   Which gets a bit ugly.
14:56:12 <bear454> suseROCKs: you summoned the genie ?
14:56:24 <suseROCKs> bear454,   I do not recall rubbing you  :-P
14:56:38 <anditosan> suseROCKs: agreed, likely I will just include one for now
14:56:39 <bear454> more like rumblestiltskin
14:56:50 <bear454> or however you spell that troll's name
14:57:01 <suseROCKs> supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
14:57:09 <anditosan> wow!!!
14:57:22 <anditosan> I can barely say that, even less type it!
14:57:28 <bear454> suseROCKs: tell me you don't have that in a speech-to-text engine
14:57:41 <suseROCKs> I don't have that in a speech-to-text engine
14:57:57 <anditosan> question to the community: is there any other piece of artwork that is needed before the release? Please let me know
14:58:06 <suseROCKs> overall, I think we're still not addressing the topic at hand here
14:58:09 <bear454> anditosan: http://minus.com/mbi39IldTn
14:58:26 <anditosan> suseROCKs: which would be?
14:58:30 <anditosan> qr codes/
14:58:33 <jospoortvliet> anditosan: banners for a website
14:58:39 <suseROCKs> anditosan,   Do you mind if I summarize what I think we need to think about in social media?
14:58:49 <anditosan> for sure budd :D
14:58:50 <jospoortvliet> as in, a horizontal and vertical banner ppl can use to promote openSUSE 12.1
14:59:00 <suseROCKs> 1. Banners
14:59:03 <jospoortvliet> we have the counters but something static, with 12.1 artwork, would be cool
14:59:06 <suseROCKs> 2. QR Codes
14:59:13 <suseROCKs> 3. Social Networking Accounts
14:59:24 <suseROCKs> e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
14:59:33 <suseROCKs> getting people to coordinate tweeting/retweeting/etc.
14:59:59 <suseROCKs> 4. News sites such as Digg, Reddit, Slashdot, etc.
15:00:20 <suseROCKs> (note, in 11.2 we succeeeded in getting Digg to list openSUSE for many hours on release day on their front page)
15:00:50 <suseROCKs> So what we need are people to monitor these different sites and push to make sure there's high visibility
15:01:04 <anditosan> 1. it looks like banners just needs help with one for facebook
15:01:04 <suseROCKs> push others to retweet, like, etc.
15:01:29 <suseROCKs> anditosan,  and carlos just agreed he'll recreate 3D Geeko for 12.1 on Facebook
15:01:55 <anditosan> suseROCKs: awesome news!!!
15:02:08 <suseROCKs> The release notes/product highlights is something we definitely want high visibility on the #4 item
15:02:20 <anditosan> 2. qr codes, we just need to define one or to links we want to feature
15:02:27 <AJaeger> So, who can coordinate overall the launch of 12.1 on social media?
15:02:52 <suseROCKs> Remember.   good marketing, the object is not marketshare, but mindshare.  When we get openSUSE name in front of as many people's minds as possible, then marketshare will complete naturally
15:03:29 <suseROCKs> anditosan,  bear454   Can you coordinate how to add Geeko logo to the QR image (if anditosan doesn't already know how?)
15:04:18 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   Let's define the list clearly about what we need to target.   We also want to gather stats as well so we can have good reference for next time
15:04:32 <bear454> anditosan: (1) use a qr generator that lets you adjust error correction... turn it way up
15:04:40 <suseROCKs> even though the whole friggin' social media landscape keep changing every few months making stats seemingly useless for future reference
15:04:59 <anditosan> bear454: if you can do it, it would be awesome!
15:05:06 <bear454> anditosan: (2) you can remove up to 30% of a QR code and have it still readable if the error correction is high enough
15:05:31 <suseROCKs> bear454,   Do you have a link to such a generator?
15:05:39 <bear454> so play with editing content, and SCANNING to make sure you've not overdone it... an unscannable but cute QR is awful
15:05:45 <bear454> yeah just a sec
15:05:48 <anditosan> bear454: I am not sure about that. It sounds like generators need all of it to be there
15:06:18 <suseROCKs> I wonder if it would be a cool idea for 3D Geeko to be holding a piece of paper or something that just happens to be the QR Code?  Then its embedded in some of our banners
15:06:31 <bear454> I use http://keremerkan.net/qr-code-and-2d-code-generator/ - it outputs SVG which makes inkscape tweaks easy
15:06:48 <bear454> anditosan: did you look at http://minus.com/mbi39IldTn
15:06:49 <bear454> ?
15:06:58 <anditosan> bear454: yes
15:07:06 <bear454> scan it
15:07:12 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: could be, nice idea, i will try
15:07:12 <suseROCKs> so as AJaeger  asks...  Who will coordinate social media?
15:07:15 <bear454> its super fast despite the missing content
15:07:55 <bear454> anditosan: http://qrarts.com/ is a great site for ideas as well
15:08:15 <suseROCKs> Note:  Social media is not something that starts on Release day.  We need to do high-traffic even before release day by getting much awareness of articles published on news.o.o etc
15:08:21 <anditosan> bear454: noted!
15:08:50 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   Great.  So wait until anditosan finishes his QR Code, and he can send it to you
15:09:08 <anditosan> suseROCKs: I can't be in charge for lack of time, but I could feature a release article or review on my blog, facebook and twitter
15:09:11 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: ok
15:09:23 <suseROCKs> anditosan,   I think QR code sin't going to take a lot of time, so can you set a deadline when you'll finish it?
15:09:27 <anditosan> ok CarlosRibeiro: I will work on that tonight
15:09:36 <anditosan> tonight!
15:09:43 <CarlosRibeiro> anditosan: fine
15:09:44 <suseROCKs> Great
15:09:55 <suseROCKs> you guys know how to contact each other?
15:10:03 <anditosan> I need email :D
15:10:17 <CarlosRibeiro> anditosan: carlosribeiro@opensuse.org
15:10:34 <anditosan> done
15:11:05 <suseROCKs> And there you have it!  South American Collaboration
15:11:14 <anditosan> ;)
15:11:17 <anditosan> yay!!!
15:11:38 <CarlosRibeiro> ;)
15:12:04 <anditosan> ok
15:12:16 <anditosan> 3. who can coordinate social media then?
15:12:35 <suseROCKs> well...
15:12:52 <AJaeger> if nobody answers, I'll ask on opensuse-marketing and make a call for volunteers.
15:12:53 <suseROCKs> I've been doing some of the SocNet work in last few months so I guess I can handle some of it, but would like to not be alone here
15:13:09 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: Great. And having a team is always good.
15:13:21 <AJaeger> SatmanUK will help with facebook
15:13:26 <suseROCKs> the tasks for SocNet are easily dividable that not doing it alone is a good idea
15:13:30 <AJaeger> he volunteered last week already.
15:13:37 <suseROCKs> ok
15:13:40 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: I can help as well, so let's put down both our names. ok?
15:13:47 <suseROCKs> ok
15:13:51 <anditosan> yay!!!
15:14:16 <anditosan> I guess that's the last point on social media as shown by suseROCKs
15:14:29 <AJaeger> Let'S move on:
15:14:36 <AJaeger> #topic infrastructure
15:14:39 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   We do need some fixing on the plugins on news.o.o     I tried to raise it with henne a while ago but no response.  Should I post on admin@?
15:14:47 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: Please do.
15:15:11 <AJaeger> right now everything is on track
15:15:16 <suseROCKs> ok
15:15:34 <AJaeger> I need to confirm from the usual aspects that they will be available at launch time and should have that soon.
15:15:48 <AJaeger> #topic distribution
15:15:58 <AJaeger> Everything on plan.
15:16:03 <AJaeger> #topic Q&A
15:16:11 <AJaeger> So, that's what's on the wiki page.
15:16:15 <AJaeger> Any questions? Anything missing?
15:16:32 * suseROCKs spins his gears to think of what's missing
15:16:53 <suseROCKs> well, we've had people "talking" about doing some videos ans screencasts.   Any movement there?
15:17:04 <suseROCKs> I think they were just talk and we shouldn't expect much on it
15:17:41 <AJaeger> part of Marketing activites - item 15.
15:17:48 <suseROCKs> ok
15:17:58 <AJaeger> But yes, we need more of those.
15:18:33 <suseROCKs> with RC2 out this weekend, we should do a hard ping to the Community to submit screencasts next week
15:19:00 <AJaeger> Jos, will you to a specific call - best on opensuse-factory as well?
15:19:31 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet ?
15:19:52 <suseROCKs> just sy supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and he'll come running back
15:20:01 <bear454> anditosan: what's the url in your QR ?
15:20:14 <bear454> anditosan: PS... shorter is *much* better
15:20:24 <anditosan> opensuse.org
15:20:37 <bear454> anditosan: that's what mine points to
15:20:45 <bear454> wanna just use that one?
15:20:48 <anditosan> bear454: great then :D
15:21:02 <suseROCKs> looks like you can put CarlosRibeiro to work now then  :-D
15:21:11 * bear454 double-checks
15:21:14 <anditosan> awesome I will email that right now then
15:21:23 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger:  suseROCKs a call for what?
15:21:24 <CarlosRibeiro> glup
15:21:27 <suseROCKs> bear454,   Out of curiosity, is there a size limit to the display of a qr code?
15:21:28 <jospoortvliet> screenshots?
15:21:36 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: CAll for screencasts/videos of 12.1
15:21:37 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   no  screencasts
15:21:52 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger:  suseROCKs can do that...
15:21:52 <jospoortvliet> surely
15:21:52 <AJaeger> so, let the GNOME team do one about 3.2 etc.
15:21:55 <suseROCKs> basic howtos would be great too
15:22:10 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Ask the boosters first - they wanted to write a how-to.
15:22:15 <bear454> suseROCKs: I don't understand your question
15:22:18 <AJaeger> Mention the URL of the howto ;)
15:22:28 <AJaeger> OK, anything else?
15:22:38 <anditosan> suseROCKs, CarlosRibeiro: Sent!
15:22:57 <suseROCKs> bear454,    For example, if CarlosRibeiro makes  3d Geeko image again with Geeko holding a tablet (which is the qr code) is there a certain size tht the code needs to be displayed in before it becomes unreadable by scanners?
15:23:15 <bear454> anditosan: yep... http://opensuse.org
15:23:24 <CarlosRibeiro> anditosan: ok, received
15:23:28 <AJaeger> brb
15:23:41 <anditosan> yay!!!
15:23:44 <bear454> suseROCKs: that's arbitrary based on the experience
15:23:58 <bear454> the barcode scanner has to be able to distinguish the pixels
15:24:03 <suseROCKs> so incorporating qr code into an image may or may not be a good idea?
15:24:27 <bear454> but it depends on display size, and camera zoom, etc.
15:24:33 <bear454> its too arbitrary
15:24:33 <anditosan> suseROCKs: I will play with the idea and create some samples for others to see
15:24:36 <suseROCKs> btw CarlosRibeiro   No suit for Geeko this time  :-)
15:24:52 <bear454> all you can really do is put it in a 'normal' situation and try with a few devices
15:25:04 <CarlosRibeiro> ok
15:25:05 <suseROCKs> ok
15:25:18 <bear454> the QR for the LinuxMagazin poster, I had a half-dozen people walk by at 3 meters distance and scan
15:25:26 <bear454> I had it on screen actual-size
15:25:29 <bear454> it scanned great
15:25:41 <suseROCKs> man you did some serious QA
15:26:02 <bear454> suseROCKs: like I said, it would be awful to put in a QR that doesn't scan
15:26:16 <bear454> and with the noise I introduced on the poster... it was necessary
15:26:24 * bear454 is excited to see it in print
15:26:34 <suseROCKs> cool
15:26:51 <anditosan> nice!
15:26:52 <suseROCKs> ok guys.  I'm going to step away for now.     Keep up the good work.
15:27:03 <anditosan> yay!!!
15:27:03 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: time for the next topic or are we done?
15:27:11 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Done.
15:27:14 <jospoortvliet> ok
15:27:16 <jospoortvliet> #endmeeting
