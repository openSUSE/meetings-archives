16:02:45 <suseROCKs> Moin Moin world!   And welcome to the first post-11.4 Meeting
16:03:09 * jospoortvliet is surprised we survived
16:03:12 <suseROCKs> I want to congratulate ALLL of you for your hard work on 11.4 release
16:03:16 <jospoortvliet> +1
16:03:29 * AJaeger claps as well ;)
16:03:34 * jospoortvliet hopes everyone catched up to sleep
16:03:57 <manugupt1> +1000
16:03:57 <suseROCKs> and a shoutout to the developers and packagers too because I'm seeing less than usual traffic to the support channel and people there are reporting little issues with their 11.4's
16:04:33 <suseROCKs> but despite any postives we have, there's always time to review and see room for improvements
16:04:37 * lupinstein is better
16:04:52 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, maybe change the -project channel topic that can be the best shout out :)
16:05:00 <yaloki> it's a mixed bag, as usual
16:05:00 <suseROCKs> particularly I'd like to find a way that we don't lose so much sleep next time  :-D
16:05:06 <yaloki> apparently wifi support is disatrous
16:05:16 <yaloki> and lots of issues with GPU drivers
16:05:19 <yaloki> "disastrous" even
16:05:47 <suseROCKs> here's what we will do today
16:06:06 <suseROCKs> it's primarily a gabfest with focus on the questions listed at http://piratepad.net/oS-Marketing-11-4-Post-mortem
16:06:09 <yaloki> but faster zypper has been noticed widely
16:06:25 <tony_> from what I've seen in Tech Support forums GPU issues spotty and mainly 32-bit, otherwise good. Wifi mostly good but surprisingly some Broadcom issues
16:06:31 <suseROCKs> and as we disucss we'll fill in our notes and then bring it up for further discussion on the ML   and eventually create a solid roadmap for the next release marketing strategy
16:06:43 <yaloki> although there were some weird issues with 32bit packages installed on 64bit systems, saw two people leave on #opensuse-fr because of that
16:07:11 <yaloki> and not having sax, as usual â€¦
16:07:27 <yaloki> suseROCKs: no, I meant "sax"
16:07:30 <yaloki> ^^
16:07:39 <tigerfoot> sax3 is for gosc
16:07:43 <suseROCKs> well I think we overspoke on our claim of broadcom support.  It did not work out of the box with linux kernel support  and according to GregKH, there's still a lot of broadcoms that aren't supported yet on openSUSE
16:08:01 <yaloki> packman has the evil broadcom-wl
16:08:12 <suseROCKs> yes that's where I ended up going
16:08:13 <yaloki> bbl
16:08:39 <suseROCKs> so I guess that's one area we had problems with... claims of things that weren't quite all that true
16:09:13 <suseROCKs> oh goody  someone is working on the pirate pad already.   Thank you.    the pad is hard for me to read on this laptop
16:09:20 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: AS usual, the release will find much more usage than any RC - and therefore more bugs are found ;-(
16:09:24 <AJaeger> We could use more testers
16:09:40 <AJaeger> And the one thing we failed was sending out timely announcements of our releases.
16:09:46 <AJaeger> RC1 was not send out at all.
16:09:59 <tigerfoot> and don't forget there's not really a RC1 due to the too big iso ...
16:10:07 <suseROCKs> ok   so   good pre-release campaigning was a factor...
16:10:18 <AJaeger> On the other hand, even if those bugs had been found, we need more people fixing bugs.
16:10:19 <tigerfoot> lot's of people out there don't want to test before rc1 (which is bad)
16:10:20 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: it seems so...
16:10:21 <suseROCKs> - RC announcements
16:10:24 <suseROCKs> - Call for testers
16:10:32 <AJaeger> - call for bugfixing
16:10:48 <tony_> @yaloki SAX was deprecated long ago, not even a part of 11.3
16:10:51 <tigerfoot> start the campaign at M4 or M5 ...
16:11:18 <tigerfoot> tony_: but people are missing that tool and asking for it, check it's score on openFATE
16:11:18 <suseROCKs> tigerfoot,   there's good and bad reasons why people don't want to test.   Perhaps we should create a strategy of easing people's concerns about testing?
16:11:32 <suseROCKs> "You too can be a tester.  it's easy!"
16:11:46 * tigerfoot already is :-)
16:11:56 <suseROCKs> already is what?
16:12:09 * tigerfoot run actually 11.5 RC1 :-)
16:12:20 <suseROCKs> I heard about that flub  LOL
16:12:33 * amonthoth is a beta tester now
16:12:46 <AJaeger> We have to motivate both - more testers and more bugfixes. I would right now (in the next 3 months or so) concentrate on the bugfixing part.
16:12:49 <tony_> @AJaeger Amen. I think more than other releases I've seen there are more bugs which should have been caught
16:13:29 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   ok  so let's look at bugfixers for a moment...    What kind of people do we need for that?   How do we increase the pool of people with good skillset to participate?
16:13:39 <suseROCKs> Education of how to fix bugs even if you're a newbie?
16:13:48 <suseROCKs> (newbie meaning new to bugfixing, not to Linux)
16:13:57 <amonthoth> how to make a tutorial to bugfixes
16:14:16 <tony_> @tigerfoot SAX was deprecated for good reason, I've followed its progress in Tech Forums. Most people will miss, but new Display Manager performs better
16:14:21 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: First you need to screen the bugs - somehow junior task. Then fix them - might need debugging/development skills
16:15:02 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, Thats a booster milestone too
16:15:02 <manugupt1> getting more people involved in -factory
16:15:03 <tigerfoot> tony_: I know that, manual config ( which is one line edition now) is pretty cool, all the rest work out of the box ...
16:15:06 <manugupt1> maybe we should ask them
16:15:10 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   okay.    There's two camps here.  One camp is those on the tech side who should focus on creating the documentation etc.  And then there's our camp where we take the information from them and market that need hard to the world.
16:15:26 <suseROCKs> we can't market what we don't know  :-)
16:16:08 <tigerfoot> suseROCKs: I disappointed now :-) I always believe you can do that
16:16:14 <suseROCKs> ok so I see a lot of talk so far about pre-release campaigning.  All good thoughts.
16:16:23 <suseROCKs> Now what about the actual release.   What was good/bad about it?
16:16:42 <suseROCKs> tigerfoot,   sure   I know everything....   :-D
16:16:43 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, The release was awesome
16:16:59 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   sure it was, but many of us nearly died from lack of sleep  LOL
16:17:03 <AJaeger> + The Product_highlights
16:17:07 <suseROCKs> I'm shocked jospoortvliet is alive!
16:17:13 <AJaeger> + working as a team - you all rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
16:17:34 <manugupt1> I have a but
16:17:43 <suseROCKs> but or butt?
16:17:56 <manugupt1> too lets continue it for a week too lets not break the writing brigade
16:18:27 <tigerfoot> AJaeger: I agree on that the team work was spectacular, be prepare for two weeks next time :-) so jospoortvliet would not be alone to Finish in hurry the Product whatever ...
16:18:28 <suseROCKs> why a week?  We should be writing forever    its constantly good noise
16:18:38 <suseROCKs> and as I always say,  our relese campaign lasts for 8 months, not a few days
16:18:52 <jospoortvliet> sure
16:18:58 <jospoortvliet> but we all need to catch our breath :D
16:19:11 <tigerfoot> suseROCKs: in the future, (next week) kde 4.6.1 is available everywhere, next month gnome3
16:19:12 <jospoortvliet> I am trying to force myself to do an xfce 4.8 review
16:19:15 <suseROCKs> Could we have been able to start the skeleton of the Product Highlights like a month or so earlier?   so we were not cramming at the last minute?
16:19:19 <jospoortvliet> and there are other ideas for articles
16:19:22 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes
16:19:26 <jospoortvliet> that is what we should've done
16:19:40 <jospoortvliet> but it's extremely hard, esp in openSUSE - it is big and often hard to know what version exactly we will ship
16:19:52 <jospoortvliet> so we could've done more but - not everything.
16:19:59 <tigerfoot> yeap there's some surprises
16:20:00 <suseROCKs> so let's put that in our roadmap....   What's the earliest that a PH can begin?   after M5?  RC1?
16:20:20 <jospoortvliet> BTW all who worked on the product highlights - they have been awesomely useful. We should now go through them and use them again and again for articles about openSUSE :D
16:20:25 <tigerfoot> M6 is normally pretty fixed
16:20:43 <jospoortvliet> for example, zypper improvements and kernel improvements haven't been put in an article yet
16:20:45 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   yes.. that PH is now my central source of information to refer to
16:20:46 <tigerfoot> suseROCKs: but check that with coolo and his plan for 11.5
16:20:55 <tony_> Maybe organizing efforts, Enforce common collaboration tools, division of labor, a Project Management app
16:20:55 <jospoortvliet> so why not just copy-paste that part and turn it into an article for the release?
16:21:18 <jospoortvliet> tony_: the more you organize the more you spend on overhead. Its something to be very carful with
16:21:18 <tigerfoot> jospoortvliet: you need a 32cores to see real big differences for the kernel :-)
16:21:23 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, no because the product highlights are everywhere
16:21:31 <manugupt1> The links atleast
16:21:38 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: yup that is true
16:21:46 <jospoortvliet> still worth turning into articles, not all ppl read the whole thing
16:21:55 <jospoortvliet> what I find unfortunate is that we didn't manage to get a video in there
16:22:02 <jospoortvliet> jdd was working on something
16:22:03 <tony_> @jos Yes, organizing overhead is a tough nut. It would mean that whoever manages has to step back and <not> do content
16:22:04 <suseROCKs> tony_,  +1 to what jospoortvliet  ssaid, and remember in FOSS,  its all volunteer, so no matter how much you organize, people will only work on what they are interested and motivated in.  No one can "order" someone to do something
16:22:15 <suseROCKs> except jospoortvliet   he orders me around....    :-D
16:22:16 <jospoortvliet> but apparently didn't finish in time. A video would've given some stats on how many ppl read it :D
16:22:19 <manugupt1> yes.. but not copy paste people might just say they have an habit pf copying
16:22:43 <jospoortvliet> tony_: yes that is happening to some extend, suseROCKs does a lot of that. But part of how a FOSS team works is also to lead by example...
16:23:00 <tony_> @suserocks Agreed. That's why project management has to account for what's on time and not. If something's not happening it has to be addressed but NO BLAME EVER
16:23:03 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: of course
16:23:14 <jospoortvliet> tony_: indeed, we can try to do that more
16:23:19 <jospoortvliet> it's why we have action items and such
16:23:29 <suseROCKs> we do have some project management tools here but I've not been too happy with them so far...   its something I'll have to re-review
16:23:57 <suseROCKs> and tony_   fyi  if you type the first few letters of a nick and hit <tab>  it will autocomplete the nick for you and then the person is properly notified that you talked to them
16:24:07 <suseROCKs> no need for "@suserocks" :-)
16:24:49 <suseROCKs> so we agree that PH should begin development after M6?
16:25:13 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes
16:25:20 <jospoortvliet> so put that in the release plan
16:25:20 <manugupt1> Ok.. I have an idea in mind too
16:25:22 <jospoortvliet> ;-)
16:25:38 <suseROCKs> #info Product Highlights should begin creation upon the release of M6 version of next release
16:25:51 <manugupt1> Can I share the idea?
16:25:53 <jospoortvliet> btw before we finish, can I get 5 min on the agenda to talk about what articles to do and who does it, over the coming week(s)?
16:26:00 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   as long as its in context  :-)
16:26:16 <manugupt1> yes it is wrt next release
16:26:19 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I guess we can give you that...  (groan)
16:26:27 * AJaeger is going to update the Launch_checklist
16:26:31 <suseROCKs> go
16:26:38 <manugupt1> Who goes me / jospoortvliet
16:26:43 <suseROCKs> you manugupt1
16:26:59 <manugupt1> Ok.. lets call the next release as the release of innovation
16:27:04 <manugupt1> Because
16:27:29 <manugupt1> Most probably we will have appstream, SaX3, systemd and a whole lot of new features maybe grub2
16:27:33 <suseROCKs> umm   no offense but that's not within the context here  :-)
16:27:49 <manugupt1> and loads of exciting stuff
16:28:03 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,  we should have a discussion about the campaign message strategy  sure.  But what we're talking about now is looking at our nuts and bolts of the marketing process itself
16:28:34 <manugupt1> Ok.. suseROCKs
16:28:53 <suseROCKs> i.e., we should be looking at what worked and what didn't work this time  so we learn from our experience here
16:29:20 <suseROCKs> lupinstein,    any thoughts on the social media/marketing front?   what was good/bad?
16:29:21 <tony_> jospoortvliet: Jos, if you want help evaluating collaboration tools, I will set aside time for that with you
16:29:23 <manugupt1> yes.. suseROCKs
16:29:49 <suseROCKs> over here tony_    :-)
16:30:35 <AJaeger> I think lupinstein got the job assigned to late ;)
16:30:41 <suseROCKs> not trying to assert my title here, but I'm the team lead and such things can be reviewed with me.   Putting too much on Jos's lap will overwhelm him once again as he works beyond just the marketing team.
16:30:58 <jospoortvliet> tony_: see what suseROCKs says - he has a darn good point ;-)
16:31:00 <AJaeger> We should have created events on facebook etc. and invited folks to it- building up some hype much earlier
16:31:06 <jospoortvliet> I love to help but time is not exactly something I have in abundance
16:31:22 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: love to hear your thoughts on social media stuff, you did great there imho
16:31:29 <jospoortvliet> but I bet there is room for improve ment
16:31:34 <tony_> suseROCKs:  I will work with any and all including you Bryen on Collaboration Tools...
16:31:42 <suseROCKs> I think lupinstein  did an amazing job in such a short period of time
16:31:57 <manugupt1> lupinstein, terrorpup HATS OFFFFFFF
16:32:19 <suseROCKs> I was churning out lots of tweets cuz I had limited time on Thursday and hope many of them were creative/cool enough to get retweeted throughout the day
16:32:40 <lupinstein> well the one thing that I notice that a lot people posted but didn't use the correct hash tag
16:32:41 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: I agree - and doing better means starting earlier and not having only one person on the task ;)
16:32:42 * suseROCKs finally replaced his Panama hat with a brand new one last night if anyone was interested  :-D
16:32:55 <manugupt1> I did a lot of tweets from any source I got
16:33:04 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: ok so we should have decided on the hashtag earlier and communicated it better
16:33:14 <jospoortvliet> should be in the release plan: decide on hashtag and communicate it EVERYWHERE
16:33:17 <suseROCKs> AJaeger,   yes but I also like that there is a central coordinator, and for that I continue to rely on lupinstein for that.  But we should definitely make sure there are no points of failure anywhere
16:33:20 <jospoortvliet> #openSUSE it was, we need to get that out
16:33:30 <lupinstein> manugupt1, was great to find stuff  from outside the group which was a big help
16:33:55 <manugupt1> but people who knew it also did not use the #tag
16:34:06 <manugupt1> Thanks luizmachado
16:34:09 <manugupt1> thanks lupinstein
16:34:09 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: sometimes ppl forget :D
16:34:14 <suseROCKs> #action   lupinstein to create a longer-term strategy for social networking
16:34:15 <tony_> I suspect re social networking it would be useful to setup the infrastructure ahead of time so that a single tweet goes everywhere
16:34:43 <jospoortvliet> tony_: afaik we have that pretty much set up, yes?
16:34:43 <lupinstein> on Facebook we really made a difference, I send status on it
16:34:46 <AJaeger> tony_: What do you mean with that?
16:34:58 <suseROCKs> tony_,   we have that   but its more than just about getting single tweets to multiple places.  its about getting others to generate buzz and noise.    its a combined effort
16:35:46 <manugupt1> We missed on reddit and digg
16:36:00 <suseROCKs> lupinstein,   please note, in the action item above,  I assign you to the strategy lead for SocNet, but you shouldn't feel like you're the only person to work on it.   Involve others to give feedback/input on the strategy design
16:36:26 <lupinstein> not problem, I welcome all to help :-)
16:36:39 <suseROCKs> and we should look for ways to keep the noise going for weeks and months, not just after release days
16:36:47 <lupinstein> and welcome all input
16:36:50 <AJaeger> lupinstein: next time ask for help - break out jobs and ask for volunteers ;)
16:36:57 <suseROCKs> we want people to watch the #opensuse hashtag daily, not once every 8 months  :-)
16:37:15 <lupinstein> AJaeger, will do
16:37:19 * rtyler wakes up
16:37:42 <suseROCKs> now   I should probably clarify a distinction here.    We have "social media" and "social networking"   both are very different animals
16:37:49 <tony_> jospoortvliet: Since I usually do social networking myself, I don't know how we did it but for starters tying in Twitter, Facebook, posted RSS feed to embed in personal websites/blogs on other Web2.0 platforms
16:37:49 <tony_> My correction to my post, I usually <don't> do social neworking, I usually spend all my time in "Technical" not extending my online life
16:38:01 <suseROCKs> and the context I speak to lupinstein about is "social networking"...   now let's look at "social media"     Did we do well there?
16:38:11 <suseROCKs> This reflects on news.opensuse.org btw
16:38:36 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: and about the mistakes we made, being too positive about certain features, let me tell an evil secret. It is true that exaggeration and over-enthusiasm somethimes leads to problems. But those hit only a few ppl and the benefits of more attention are often worth it. See the effects of advertising LibreOffice - we're of course not REALLY the first but it was mentioned and echoed EVERYWHERE.
16:38:41 <jospoortvliet> Ubuntu uses this trick ALL THE TIME
16:38:49 <jospoortvliet> and it's why THEY are on top in GOOGLE Trends
16:38:54 <jospoortvliet> and NOT their number of users...
16:39:17 <jospoortvliet> tony_: well you did fine, that's a great start :D
16:39:25 <jospoortvliet> tony_: but you mean having one platform to get it all out
16:39:27 <lupinstein> well I want to really sit down see what worked and want didn't and then go from there
16:39:32 <jospoortvliet> tony_: that is not a bad idea for sure...
16:39:37 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   in general, I'm not concerned with some of the faux pax's we made there.   My concern is we probably didn't get enough content generated in the first place
16:39:38 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: that's what this is supposed to be :D
16:39:48 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: that is true to some extend at least...
16:39:51 <suseROCKs> a lot of work rested on manugupt1  and he tried repeatedly to get others on board, and with lack of real success
16:40:06 <suseROCKs> he really saved us.  Bravo manugupt1
16:41:10 <jospoortvliet> yes manugupt1 deserves a special treat
16:41:13 <suseROCKs> imo,  we needed two things...  a)  more writers to be available.  I see a need to recruit mroe writers.  and b)  Product Highlights avaialable earlier thus inspiring more potential storylines
16:41:23 <jospoortvliet> pretty much all the big articles that came out in the days before the release came from him...
16:41:32 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs:  yup
16:42:01 <suseROCKs> and we should wecome writers even if they're not openSUSE users.    Writers are always looking for places where they can show off their writing abilities
16:42:32 <jospoortvliet> and for info of all: those articles don't need to be perfect. Manu's got a lot of changes - I copied in large parts of our feature guide to make them bigger. And his english isn't perfect. BUT still without him we would not have had them. The start of an article is often the hardest part, editing is quite easy even if it ends up adding or changing a lot!
16:42:52 <lupinstein> I know I wanted to help more with writing, but been tied down at work :(
16:43:37 <suseROCKs> +1 jospoortvliet
16:43:46 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: well it's not about blaming anyone, we need to get new ppl all the time.
16:44:00 <jospoortvliet> And we do, so we shouldn't complain. It didn't work out perfect but it went great
16:44:14 <suseROCKs> and in that context... the fact that we did SOOO much with so few people, is ROCK AWESOME
16:44:14 <jospoortvliet> we DID do almost twice as good as last release, remember ;-)
16:44:24 <jospoortvliet> and it's not like that release was so horrible...
16:44:29 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yup
16:44:57 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: The release went very good - compared to others
16:45:08 <suseROCKs> so jospoortvliet    since this is relevant to your "5 minute addition"  how else do you feel we can improve on outputting more material?
16:45:27 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: the timing you mentioned is the biggest thing
16:45:39 <jospoortvliet> its why I wanted to have a marketing meeting around beginning of feb...
16:45:42 <jospoortvliet> not end :D
16:45:53 * tigerfoot too :-)
16:45:59 <suseROCKs> well  yes and no
16:46:01 <manugupt1> Thanks all I was out to get some water
16:46:25 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: not saying that doing it at scale wasn't the right choice
16:46:27 <jospoortvliet> it was
16:46:29 <rtyler> manugupt1: you missed some really good praise :)
16:46:33 <jospoortvliet> lol
16:46:34 <suseROCKs> not to sound like I am slamming anyone, but it was mentioned a number of times that we are not supposed to wait until hackfest to start working.  But people didn't do much before (and even after)  hackfest.
16:46:41 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: sure
16:46:48 <suseROCKs> we need people to roll up their sleeves on their own.  How do we motivate this?
16:46:48 <jospoortvliet> but a meeting (or a few meetings) can really help start up
16:46:54 <jospoortvliet> moreover many didn't really know how this thing worked
16:47:01 <suseROCKs> yes
16:47:03 <jospoortvliet> I started the feature guide much earlier but it only got traction AT the meeting
16:47:10 <jospoortvliet> it needed face to face explanation of how that thing works
16:47:12 <jospoortvliet> it still does
16:47:13 <lupinstein> one thing not to take a way for talk about writers, I was very happy to see the number of Geeko on Facebook for the two days of the release.
16:47:15 <jospoortvliet> ;-)
16:47:19 <manugupt1> The best of irc rtyler you dont miss praises :)
16:47:28 <jospoortvliet> now ppl have seen it, next time you can all help writing it much better, right? ;-)
16:47:47 <jospoortvliet> so for next time, I think we'd do a lot better already if we have that feature guide a bit earlier we'll rock.
16:47:57 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   but at the same time, can we say we're going to have a marketing hackfest before each release?   We can't depend on that, although I hope the money-powers that be will now see that such hackfests have positive results and need to be a regular thing
16:48:03 <jospoortvliet> I think, as I can't affort such a marketing meeting next time, that we should have smaller meetings in other places
16:48:24 <jospoortvliet> eg one in europe one in usa one brazil or so, or virtual ones, collaboration days, things like that
16:48:46 <suseROCKs> we did  pretty well with our Collaboration Days and I do intend to have more of those
16:48:51 <suseROCKs> like once every 2-3 months
16:49:04 <rtyler> jospoortvliet: I think scheduling some hack-days virtually for weekends prior to the release would help
16:49:11 <amonthoth> should we do a public survey post intalling and publishing it to get usabilitiy metrics and to know why ppl will keep using oS 114 or not
16:49:12 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: the meeting was a big success (but where is that report to prove it you promised? :D ) but doing it more than once every few years simply won't happen
16:49:17 <rtyler> I simply can't afford to spend a lot of time on openSUSE during the week :/
16:49:17 <jospoortvliet> $10.000 is a lot of money
16:49:38 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   you'll be getting that report   no worries  :-D
16:49:44 <manugupt1> rtyler, +1
16:49:45 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: goooood :D
16:49:52 <lupinstein> next time hackfest at my house
16:49:59 <lupinstein> save a lot of money
16:50:16 <suseROCKs> rtyler,    nothing to stop you from saying  "You know what guys?  We need to collaborate on <item>  Let's meet on Saturday and talk about it together."
16:50:16 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: yeah, I know. What lupinstein suggests is actually a good idea. Having smaller meetings with more local ppl at somebody's place...
16:50:23 <jospoortvliet> that's quite doable
16:50:28 <tigerfoot> lupinstein: I am
16:50:29 <manugupt1> Ok.. once again all I have a few ideas in my mind need your opinions regarding it even though it may / may not fall directly under marketing
16:50:47 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: wait a bit pls
16:50:54 <manugupt1> Ok.. jospoortvliet
16:50:55 * suseROCKs hides the fact that he has 4 bedrooms in his house and only one is used.  shhhh
16:50:59 <jospoortvliet> amonthoth: good idea, but can you bring it up a bit later too
16:51:01 <rtyler> suseROCKs: I agree, I hadn't really participated in 11.3, so *now* I know this :P
16:51:07 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: now THAT is interesting :D
16:51:15 <rtyler> jospoortvliet: the other rooms are where the bodies are stashed
16:51:22 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: oh....
16:51:24 <jospoortvliet> but back on topic
16:51:31 <jospoortvliet> the question was how can we do better next time
16:51:33 <jospoortvliet> so a few things
16:51:35 <jospoortvliet> - start earlier
16:51:37 <jospoortvliet> - do more meetings
16:51:53 <suseROCKs> well   jospoortvliet   I'd rephrase that to "do more focused meetings"
16:51:54 <jospoortvliet> - I think we agree the product highlights are central to our efforts
16:51:55 <AJaeger> suseROCKs: I have a survey monkey account if you want to do a proper survey
16:52:04 <AJaeger> brb
16:52:25 <lupinstein> jospoortvliet, start early, get one person to manager task, but get more to help with the task.
16:52:25 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: suseROCKs  it was amonthoth's idea, let him lead it :D but let's first focus on doing better next time, communicaton wise
16:52:41 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: we always need more ppl. The question is not IF but HOW.
16:52:42 <suseROCKs> yeah  I missed something about a survey??
16:52:52 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: I asked amonthoth to bring it up again
16:52:58 <jospoortvliet> focus pls focus
16:53:08 <tony2> Recommend for next time creating Doc templates based on existing Docs, intention to try to "fill in the blanks" as much as possible
16:53:09 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: so how could we do the social media better
16:53:10 <rtyler> jospoortvliet: I think another point is that we should all be running the RCs that we're writing articles about and checking things out :P
16:53:13 * suseROCKs refocuses
16:53:14 <jospoortvliet> how can we coordinate better?
16:53:23 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: good point
16:53:30 <lupinstein> jospoortvliet,  that a good question because I know I when to the #suse asking for help to do digg, and didn't get a lot of people.
16:53:35 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: and it would help if earlier rc's would have artwork for us
16:53:39 <rtyler> I think as soon as RC1 comes out, we should start preparing materials
16:53:57 <rtyler> jospoortvliet: screenshots are one thing, I'm referring more to some of the versionconfusion with the KDE/GNOME articles
16:54:01 <tigerfoot> rtyler: M5 is good ...
16:54:01 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: the earlier idea was to start the feature guide full-steam when M6 is out
16:54:02 <suseROCKs> and with virtualbox,  no excuse anymore to not be running RC's
16:54:11 <rtyler> ah
16:54:14 <rtyler> I like that idea too :P
16:54:14 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: good point
16:54:32 <lupinstein> +1 M5, then we can make it more focus when get close to release
16:54:33 <suseROCKs> m6 to start the feature guide,  RC to be the last point of excuse to not be running in VM.  :-)
16:54:40 <rtyler> too bad we can't get M5/6 in SUSE Studio for test driving the release ;)
16:54:40 <tigerfoot> there's one week between M5 -> M6 -> one week RC1, one Week RC2
16:54:46 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: we started the feature guide earlier actually
16:55:00 <jospoortvliet> see tigerfoot's comment
16:55:15 <rtyler> hate to ask the stupid question, but how does this whole release process change our marketing plans with the advent of Tumbleweed?
16:55:19 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   ok.  But when is the actual freeze when we cannot add more to the release?
16:55:31 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, after rc2
16:55:31 <jospoortvliet> look I can do the skeleton on the feature guide. But I noticed that a big barrier to contribution was the question of HOW to contribute
16:55:38 <jospoortvliet> I bet this is relevant for more things
16:55:42 * rtyler apologizes for being late, if this was already covered
16:55:48 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: that happens only when the GM is made :D
16:55:57 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: seriously, they can change big things until release day...
16:56:02 <jospoortvliet> so we can't rely on that :(
16:56:03 <suseROCKs> rtyler,   well..  if we continue to finetune our message and build up sustained noise, it won't really matter.    People should be interested in and trying out openSUSE no matter whether it was just released yestereday or 3 months ago
16:56:20 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   no  there's a freeze point.
16:56:23 <tony2> rtyler: My current impression of Tumbleweed is that bugs are still being worked out. Mostly works but not completely so it'll be awhile before we know future major releases will end
16:56:37 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: ignore tumbleweed for that, we focus on the release. That's how NEW users get openSUSE.
16:56:38 <suseROCKs> though you can convince coolo to go past the freeze point, you have to really convince him
16:56:46 <jospoortvliet> tumbleweed is simply an awesome feature
16:56:48 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: true, true
16:56:56 <lupinstein> well that's why you start early then at the time of the release go thru and pick what important, believe or not that how a lot of magazine do it
16:56:57 <rtyler> tony2: good to know, i'll drop you an email later with more questions I have regarding tumbleweed for omgsuse :)
16:57:05 <jospoortvliet> but for minor bugfix releases - well, it's hard to lock things :(
16:57:17 <suseROCKs> brb guys
16:57:26 <lupinstein> they might have about 50 stories but at the time of release pick only the top 15 that matter
16:57:27 <jospoortvliet> sigh and suseROCKs runs away?
16:58:23 <Dominian> in the middle of a meeting?
16:58:24 <Dominian> shame!
16:59:27 * tigerfoot think suseROCKs goes to return the meat to dry in unoccupied rooms :-)
16:59:35 <suseROCKs> im back
16:59:53 <jospoortvliet> ok let's try to re-focus again
17:00:01 <tony2> jospoortvliet: Re how people contribute should probably be addressed when we can find sufficient collab tools
17:00:18 <jospoortvliet> we were talking about getting more writing finished earlier
17:00:29 <Dominian> hrm.. looking at the digg post for the release announcement.. only 17 people dugg it? wtf
17:00:35 <suseROCKs> tony2,  do you feel that it is unclear to people that come to the marketing team how they can contribute?   Should we provide more solid guidance?
17:00:40 <jospoortvliet> and about the digg and other social media stuff
17:00:42 <rtyler> Dominian: in all fairness, digg only has 35 users now :P
17:00:48 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: I think he has a point
17:00:55 <Dominian> rtyler: do what!?
17:00:55 <jospoortvliet> we need to document things more clearly
17:01:05 <jospoortvliet> eg I know ppl make video's like jdd but they weren't used in the end
17:01:06 <jospoortvliet> too bad
17:01:12 <jospoortvliet> we need to have clear what we require for the feature guide
17:01:13 <suseROCKs> its a good point.     We have the jobs page but we rreally didn't put much energy on that
17:01:18 <jospoortvliet> and I can write up something for that :D
17:01:22 <rtyler> jospoortvliet: tacking on to tony2's point, for this release I basically just hung out and waited for somebody to tell me to do something :P
17:01:23 <jospoortvliet> so give me that action item
17:01:33 <jospoortvliet> rtyler: that was quite OK
17:01:41 <Dominian> Yeah I hung out.. didn' thave to do anything
17:01:44 <tony2> suseROCKs: When people know which tools to use and how, then people should be able to contribute on their own time and in a disconnected way, less pressure sync with others
17:01:46 <Dominian> I upgraded, that's about it :)
17:01:51 <Dominian> oh and dugg the article on digg.com
17:01:57 <suseROCKs> #action jospoortvliet to create guidelines for creating a solid and awesome Product Highlights
17:02:24 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, jospoortvliet why not use retro
17:02:28 <suseROCKs> tony2,   excellent point.  I will take that into consideration
17:02:31 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: what is that?
17:02:38 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, one sec
17:02:41 <manugupt1> http://retro.opensuse.org/
17:02:53 <suseROCKs> retro sucks in my opinion and you can't just use it,  you have to authorize people to use it
17:03:43 <suseROCKs> its a tool with big administrative overhead and the landing page can only point to the booster project which misleads people and makes it hard to navigate
17:04:11 <suseROCKs> I'm all for hearing ideas from tony2 for better project management tools that fit well in our team
17:04:28 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: and even the boosters don't use it...
17:04:33 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, I am saying let us have ours
17:04:35 <suseROCKs> provided we can integrate it into our infrastructure.
17:04:49 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, I think they do atleast they all mark what has been done and not
17:05:12 <manugupt1> That is how it looks from outside any way
17:05:14 <suseROCKs> boosters use it extensively   but other teams don't because it just is too unweildy
17:05:21 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: problem with project management: it is overhead. Someone should take on a task, feel responsible, and get others to help. That is all the managmeent you need - a person who is responsible for something. That was me for the feature guide and chuck for the social media etc
17:05:30 <tony2> suseROCKs: :) Just don't ask me today. Yesterday I started d/l more project management from OSS, I will need to know if I find a 3rd party how difficult to get mounted on a Novell or openSUSE Server
17:05:53 <suseROCKs> tony2,   sure  we have a bit of time to figure out a good sane approach.
17:05:56 <manugupt1> tony2, anything with ror, php mysql and no java is fine I think
17:05:58 <suseROCKs> ok back to riting
17:06:36 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   more to say on writing?
17:06:59 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: nope, will write that page
17:07:11 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   to be honest, I feel the news team needs to have a meeting to review a lot of things.  Not just related to release, but the overall process.   Is it working well?  not working well?  etc.
17:07:24 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: agreed
17:07:30 <jospoortvliet> it's rather quiet right now anyway
17:07:36 <jospoortvliet> and it shouldn't be, around release :D
17:07:37 <suseROCKs> yes
17:07:45 <jospoortvliet> but part of it is that I don't even keep up with news@o.o mail :(
17:07:50 <suseROCKs> who wants to call that meeting?
17:07:51 <Dominian> suseROCKs: Have you guys thought about using something like redmine or dotProject.net software for project management?
17:08:49 <suseROCKs> Dominian,   no  and tbh  right now if we ask for a new tool to be added, we'll get pushback  "We already have retro and it worksforme"   we need to clearly elaborate why something new would be better
17:09:02 <tony2> Dominian: If anyone has a recommendation, private offline to me and I'll be sure to take a look at it and then discuss with Bryen
17:09:27 <lupinstein> call
17:09:33 <AJaeger2> Let's first figure out what are our requirements. I hate evening too many different tools but we need to get our job done.
17:09:46 <suseROCKs> right
17:09:56 <suseROCKs> as stated, we need to ensure a sane approach
17:09:57 * rtyler agrees
17:10:14 <suseROCKs> don't implement a need for the sake of need.   One week's need is another week's option  :-D
17:10:17 <tony2> AJaeger2: I hope I'm experienced enough evaluating Collab to recommend something both Usable and User Friendly
17:10:42 <AJaeger2> tony2: First we need to know what problems we have ;)
17:10:44 <suseROCKs> ok so what other areas can we talk about today?
17:10:57 <manugupt1> I have a lot to talk about
17:11:00 <suseROCKs> I don't think we did a good enough job rallying up the ambassadors.   What do you guys think?
17:11:38 * AJaeger2 agrees
17:11:40 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, again the question is how
17:11:44 <manugupt1> to rally them up
17:11:57 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,    #1 solution in my mind is consolidation.;
17:12:07 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, need to do it asap
17:12:11 <Dominian> tony2: WEll I'll have to read up on retro..
17:12:21 <Dominian> suseROCKs: I mean what is wrong with retro that you don't like? Watch features are you guys looking for?
17:12:24 <suseROCKs> we have too many things spread out and we're starting to talk about getting it all back together.   Ambassador, marketing, artwork lists   all are too spread apart and one hand doesn't know what the other is doing
17:12:34 <tony2> AJaeger2: Off the top of my head common "Must Have" Centralized bulletin board for all, Doc Management supporting revisioning, proper Auth/Auth/Admin levels, optional SSO discussion tools, more
17:12:41 <manugupt1> Lets have a single ML
17:13:03 <manugupt1> for artwork marketing multimedia and ambassadors
17:13:07 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   and that's on my todo to send out a discussion on that on all 3 ml's to get everyone to agree to consolidation
17:13:17 <amonthoth> suseROCKs: +1
17:13:29 <suseROCKs> yeah see  I didn't even know a multimedia ml existed until very recently  :-)
17:13:34 <tony2> suseROCKs:  That's why on my "Must Have" list is a Centralized bulletin board so common info can be posted for all
17:13:52 <manugupt1> tony2, suseROCKs why not use connect better
17:14:00 <manugupt1> Whats the use otherwise
17:14:04 <suseROCKs> tony2,    yup   its a issue that's getting raised repeatedly lately and a solution must come soon
17:14:11 <tony2> manugupt1: Anything can be considered
17:14:13 <amonthoth> there is shattered info and resources
17:14:16 <AJaeger2> tony2: Let's continue this discussion another time. I'd like to understand what exactly you mean and where it hinders us today.
17:14:27 * tigerfoot ask tony2 manugupt1 Dominian to postpone any comment on tools to after meeting ...
17:14:42 <tony2> AJaeger2: Agreed
17:14:51 <manugupt1> tigerfoot, ok
17:15:08 <suseROCKs> regardless of the fact that we didn't make enough noise with ambassadors, its not over yet.  We can continue to make noise NOW because we need more launch parties
17:15:26 <suseROCKs> launch parties do not have to be around the date of a release.   I believe lupinstein  has his scheduled for april
17:15:37 <lupinstein> may
17:15:43 <suseROCKs> ok may
17:15:44 <suseROCKs> :-D
17:15:55 <lupinstein> May 14th, at the ITT Linux Install Fest
17:16:02 <suseROCKs> I have not seen a single rally call to ambassadors on that ml.    manugupt1 warlordfff or carlos?
17:16:29 <Dominian> Yeah there hasn't been much traffic on the ambassador's list that I've seen as of late
17:16:30 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, There was by lupinstein I believe for Launch parties
17:16:35 <manugupt1> no one responded
17:17:04 <lupinstein> yea, think that's why henne didn't use the page we worked on, waste of time
17:17:30 <suseROCKs> lupinstein,  manugupt1   so what do you think is the reason for lack of interest?
17:18:23 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, Cannot say... people who started off as ambassadors are actually and contributing awesome
17:18:25 <lupinstein> To be honest, I don't think are following the ambassador list
17:18:42 <manugupt1> we just have 2 extremes who work and who do not
17:18:48 <jospoortvliet> sorry for being away for a while
17:18:55 <suseROCKs> ok
17:18:55 <lupinstein> only traffic I seen jos, the welcome team and my e-mail
17:18:58 <jospoortvliet> I disagree in bringing ambassadors too close to international marketing
17:19:12 <manugupt1> being an ambassador is something like you can do once in an year
17:19:12 <jospoortvliet> actually I'd advocate for ambassadors to get a ML per country AND an easy way to reach them all by internationals
17:19:27 <jospoortvliet> if you're an ambassador in Brazil or Greece, chances are about 0.1% that you want to be on an english ML
17:19:30 <jospoortvliet> ANY english ML
17:19:35 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   not necessarily.  There's plenty of ways to be an ambassador more than once a year
17:19:43 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, does not work that way except for a few countries
17:19:44 <jospoortvliet> as long as we demand you to understand english we limit ourselves a lot
17:19:50 <lupinstein> jos, then how we will know if they are doing anything
17:19:52 <jospoortvliet> the locals need to be able to have their own thing
17:20:11 <AJaeger2> Regarding ambassadors, tell me once I can speak a few minutes about openSUSE 11.4 PromoDVDs...
17:20:17 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,    fair enough re: language barriers.   But how do we convey to those in different languages what they need/should be doing and get them up to speed?
17:20:21 <jospoortvliet> and by having a way to address them all at once (the ambassador ML should send mails to each of those ML's for example?!? and be moderated more strongly? something like that) we have our connection with international project
17:20:30 <jospoortvliet> many ppl who could be ambassador right now are not
17:20:48 <jospoortvliet> that was my rant :D
17:21:10 * tigerfoot agree with locals & jospoortvliet
17:21:22 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I'm also of the inclination that "ambassador" is just a title  and in reality it means a title plus the added buraruacy of writing reports
17:21:48 <manugupt1> manugupt1, does not see any point probably because he is in India where computers run in English
17:22:14 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes and no
17:22:15 <suseROCKs> for example, when I mentioned that Tony is our ambassador to San Diego, someone pointed out he's not officially an ambassador.  But to me, it makes no difference that he didn't register.  he still represented and did a good job, and I'm sure he doesn't want the obligation of writing a report every time he ambassades  (yes I just invented a verb)
17:22:38 <jospoortvliet> true true
17:22:44 <suseROCKs> I'm not a registered ambassador and I still represent the project
17:22:54 <jospoortvliet> but we should make it easier to make those event reports (a web form maybe) and give incentives to do so
17:22:58 <jospoortvliet> as we discussed in the marketing meeting!
17:23:10 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, everything we could has been done
17:23:17 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: hell no
17:23:19 <lupinstein> I thought the point of the ambassador was to get the word out and to get reports on what they doing, having a center mailing issue is great, but before we go to local group we need to use the tools that are in place. That a big problem, that no one uses what is in place.
17:23:22 <suseROCKs> heh
17:23:23 <manugupt1> look at Stathis He does it so much
17:23:25 <jospoortvliet> it is still a lot of work to make an event report
17:23:40 <jospoortvliet> filling in a form on a site is 10000x easier than making a wiki page
17:23:48 <Dominian> and some ambassadors, like myself, promote in other ways.. not just at events et al.
17:23:49 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   sure ambassadors get the word out.  But plenty of people in the project get the word out without being an ambassador  (and do a good job of it too)
17:23:51 <jospoortvliet> that is a barier much bigger than what most ppl are iwlling to do
17:23:53 <lupinstein> Agree jospoortvliet I hate the wiki
17:23:54 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: that too :D
17:23:55 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, the more you will add to it, less is will be the over head
17:24:01 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: sure
17:24:05 <lupinstein> it a f'in pain to file reports
17:24:05 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, then I propose a google form
17:24:14 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: that would be fine if it was open source ;-)
17:24:20 <jospoortvliet> you know how some ppl would respond...
17:24:25 <jospoortvliet> but I'd be fine with that
17:24:30 <Dominian> I havfe no time to get to events.. so me creating reports of what I'm doing would be like "Interjected openSUSE and its features into a conversation that involved Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS... life is good"
17:24:35 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, then I will have to make a PHP Script when I have time
17:24:47 <lupinstein> hell I could write an nice php form that could post reports
17:24:48 <manugupt1> Basically mail to the marketing ML
17:24:57 <manugupt1> lupinstein, you got me :)
17:24:59 <jospoortvliet> the thing we need is that those reports once filled in get send to the marketing ML, are aggregated on an RSS feed, go to planet openSUSE, are visibe on news.opensuse.org in a box somewhere, stuff like that
17:25:04 <jospoortvliet> now writing a report is quite useless
17:25:29 <jospoortvliet> something needs to be done with the reports
17:25:31 <Dominian> wait.. what is IN the report?
17:25:32 <suseROCKs> ok so we have a lot of thoughts about how to improve and solidify the ambassador program,  but the immediate need right now is to figure out how to get the ambassadors to make the noise we need right now...
17:25:35 <diamond_gr> trying to follow the wiki.
17:25:37 <jospoortvliet> they should be aggregated in the ambassador's profile in the wiki
17:25:40 <diamond_gr> wiki is fine
17:25:40 <lupinstein> jospoortvliet, to do that I recomment not using the wiki, because as you stated it need to be simple. Remember KISS
17:25:41 <jospoortvliet> so they buidl a trackrecord
17:25:43 <Dominian> I would think as ambassadors you'd want their personal views/experiences from their findings?
17:25:48 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, lupinstein I propose this Lets have a php form that mails to the Marketing ML
17:25:50 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: I don't care what tech we use
17:25:56 <jospoortvliet> as long as we make the proces automated and easy
17:26:12 <manugupt1> lupinstein, what do you say??
17:26:13 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: mail is not enough, it should end up in an ambassadors profile if he/she was there
17:26:16 <jospoortvliet> so they get bragging rights
17:26:17 <suseROCKs> yes  less bureaucracy
17:26:34 <jospoortvliet> and it should be visible somewhere so we can go over them say once per 3 monts, and write a nice article aobut the events
17:26:36 <jospoortvliet> and we can track statistics
17:26:44 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, we can have a database about it just that
17:26:46 <jospoortvliet> and we can have a feed on our homepage showing the events suse has been at
17:26:47 <Dominian> What other promotional materials are provided to ambassadors, if any?  Just curious.
17:27:00 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: look at teh marketing materials page in the wiki
17:27:04 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   you mean openSUSE,  right?
17:27:05 <Dominian> thanks
17:27:05 <lupinstein> manugupt1, you don't know KISS -- Keep it Simple St****.  The wiki is not Simple
17:27:09 <tony2> Cool. I'll add all the recent observations to my "Collab Tools Feature List"
17:27:11 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: sure don't complain dude
17:27:17 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, thats something big you are thinking now
17:27:22 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: again I don't care where it ends up as long as it is easy
17:27:23 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I was just doing what AJaeger2  does  :-D
17:27:24 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: yes I know
17:27:25 <jospoortvliet> it is big
17:27:44 <suseROCKs> ok back to the pressing question...  not the format...   What can we do to boost ambassador noise RIGHT NOW?
17:27:48 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: this is something we might be able to do in connect, yes?
17:28:00 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: can we have one more minute for this idea?
17:28:02 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, exactly we need to identify connect
17:28:03 <suseROCKs> How can we communicate to them and inspire them to run out and do a launch party soon?
17:28:10 <jospoortvliet> I think we have an opportunity of making the ambassadorship more meaningful
17:28:10 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   ok
17:28:12 <jospoortvliet> and visible
17:28:18 <lupinstein> jospoortvliet, right now if you asked me to do something on the wiki, I rather cut my wrist and watch myself bleed
17:28:34 <manugupt1> We as a team are failing the boosters hardwork I am sorry but I feel this way connect is being ignored
17:28:37 <lupinstein> the pain of cutting my wrist is less painful than to use the wiki
17:28:45 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: ok. I guess you understand what I am thinking about...
17:28:55 <lupinstein> don't believe ask tigerfoot, he will back me
17:28:59 <jospoortvliet> so how about I send a mail to the boosters about connect, asking if this is something they can do with it
17:29:01 <jospoortvliet> ?
17:29:05 <jospoortvliet> I'm sure they will see a nail :D
17:29:07 <jospoortvliet> hehe
17:29:11 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, yes :)
17:29:14 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   the problem with Connect or any other tool is that it is just one more thing someone has to go to and be aware of its existence.   The fewer places people have to go to, the better
17:29:29 <Dominian> ya know.. I'm starting to see a common theme...
17:29:32 <Dominian> too many tools
17:29:40 <suseROCKs> exactly
17:29:44 <Dominian> iirc the meeting last week in #opensuse-project was smililary focused
17:29:51 <Dominian> wow.. bad spelling
17:29:54 <suseROCKs> welcome to ambassadors.   Please go to wiki, connect, retro, ml....
17:29:54 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: lupinstein you two would you be willing to help the boosters with this, either suggesting things or doing your PHP fu?
17:29:57 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, when we are thinking of multiple tools here why nt then integrate everything with connect
17:30:04 <jospoortvliet> in that case I add you in CC when mailing
17:30:32 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: I want it integrated in wiki etc, connect - that's what the boosters want to use for identity management in all of openSUSE. it will be everywhere anyway
17:30:32 <lupinstein> I am game for anything that would make life easier and do like you said
17:30:36 <jospoortvliet> so let's reinforce that pls
17:30:40 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,  welll  if there's a better way to integrate, then great.   But right now, integration isn't very good, is it?
17:30:41 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: ok
17:30:58 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: suseROCKs: see what I just said :D
17:31:11 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: right now it's not there
17:31:12 <tigerfoot> just check that post http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/03/virtual-opensuse-11-4-release-party/
17:31:13 <suseROCKs> yes
17:31:18 <jospoortvliet> but they work on that...
17:31:19 * AJaeger2 likes to interrupt for a second, since I have to leave now
17:31:19 <Dominian> question: what do other projects provide to their 'ambassassors' as tools?
17:31:25 <tigerfoot> Michal made it with a google doc :-)
17:31:34 <suseROCKs> AJaeger2,   go for it
17:31:40 <tigerfoot> don't know how he will get the result ...
17:31:57 <AJaeger2> I'm currently buried with sending out of openSUSE DVDs and thus we have restored an old page:
17:31:58 <AJaeger2> http://software.opensuse.org/order/new
17:32:12 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: I don't really know, would be good to know... Feel free to spend a bit time on analyzing that and mail the marketing ML with it, would be very interesting and you can do that in an hour or so...
17:32:19 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger2:  +1
17:32:21 <AJaeger2> Please review the page and send me your comments on how to change the text to make it friendly (me = aj at opensuse dot org)
17:32:33 <AJaeger2> The page is not functional yet, so don't order anything
17:32:36 <Dominian> jospoortvliet: Well, I'm just going over the marketing materials site...
17:32:39 <Dominian> I see one big issue
17:32:40 <Dominian> its not finished.
17:32:44 <Dominian> lots of gaps
17:32:53 <suseROCKs> AJaeger2,    we have 11.4's to ship already?
17:32:54 <AJaeger2> But I want to use that page as only way to advertize openSUSE 11.4 media
17:33:15 <AJaeger2> openSUSE 11.4 PromoDVDs will not be ready before next weeks, as soon as I know more details, I tell you.
17:33:29 <suseROCKs> #action  team to review text of http://software.opensuse.org/order/new and send comments to AJaeger
17:33:33 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: yup you are right we need a lot more work on those
17:33:36 <lupinstein> :( I got Texas Linux Fest on April 2nd
17:33:39 <manugupt1> AJaeger2, will it be ready by the time vuntz comes to India
17:33:44 <Dominian> jospoortvliet: quite a bit of work
17:33:51 <suseROCKs> AJaeger2,   ok  for now I'm telling people don't expect until early April.  Is that a fair estimate?
17:33:58 <jospoortvliet> any help is appreciated, and more importantly, we need someone to 'adopt' one of those things, have it as his/her baby and push others to get it done until it is done
17:33:58 <AJaeger2> manugupt1: AS soon as I know details, I tell you ;)
17:34:01 <jospoortvliet> then move on to the next :D
17:34:04 <Dominian> jospoortvliet: I think a lot of my issue with contributing.. I think I have a form of ADD.. because I try to pay attention to too much at one time!
17:34:06 <jospoortvliet> so if you're looking for a baby, pick one :D
17:34:08 <manugupt1> thanks AJaeger2
17:34:12 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: same for me :D
17:34:15 <AJaeger2> suseROCKs: Yes but I hope earlier
17:34:20 <tony2> brb everybody. Will post next when I have something to say
17:34:24 <jospoortvliet> Dominian: so pick a few babies there and push them :D
17:34:28 <Dominian> jospoortvliet: hehe
17:34:35 <AJaeger2> But therefore I need to have the above page live to make everything much smoother and easier on my part.
17:34:40 <suseROCKs> AJaeger2,   anything else?
17:34:55 <AJaeger2> That's it from me for now - need to take care of some issues here...
17:34:59 <lupinstein> I wish I has access to the DVD copier then I could burn my own for TLF.
17:35:05 <AJaeger2> thanks and sorry for the interruption
17:35:07 <suseROCKs> ok thanks AJaeger2
17:35:48 <suseROCKs> lupinstein,   bribe AJaeger2 and he'll maybe give you first priority.    You just might be able to get it in time
17:36:04 <Dominian> Is there a list of al the tools out there? a la news.o.o, forums.o.o, connect.o.o etc?
17:36:32 <lupinstein> AJaeger2, need a babysitter, wink wink, cut your grass, wash your car.
17:36:59 <manugupt1> What else do we have to cover
17:37:28 <suseROCKs> we were talking about improving the overall ambassador program and its tools....
17:37:38 <suseROCKs> did we come to conclusions or does it require more debate?
17:37:55 <manugupt1> We need conclusions
17:38:03 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet?
17:38:25 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: we still need to get clear what we can do better in the social media area
17:38:48 <lupinstein> ok, I will on that
17:38:50 <jospoortvliet> in the ambassadors area as well - we have one thing (make event reports more visible and maybe create local ML's)
17:38:57 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   social media or social networking?   Let's make sure we always make that distinction  :-)
17:38:57 <tony2> Dominian: Usually periodically I check out the CRM demo sites. One place, try out everything, anything
17:39:03 <tigerfoot> did we notice the action about the merging of ML ?
17:39:04 <lupinstein> if you want to tag it for item of action
17:39:05 <Dominian> eh
17:39:06 <jospoortvliet> eg ask kostas how he works - the local team has their own infrastructure.
17:39:09 <suseROCKs> two very different beasts
17:39:09 <jospoortvliet> we should make that easier
17:39:19 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, I have only one issue with more MLs
17:39:21 <Dominian> tony2: my point being I don't know where all these sites are :)
17:39:24 <jospoortvliet> tigerfoot: merging artwork and marketing - good. merging ambassadors - will just chase them away
17:39:45 <suseROCKs> and merging multimedia?
17:39:46 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: if you don't speak english having a greek ambassador list is quite crucial you know...
17:40:00 <Dominian> hrm..
17:40:04 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: fine too. I want to do something about language barriers, that's what we have to break...
17:40:08 <manugupt1> we have around 120 ambassador then it does not help
17:40:22 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: social media incl social networks
17:40:25 <Dominian> here's something intereseting I'm seeing on the Fedora ambassadors.. they provide an ambassador's polo shirt and/or a button up shirt
17:40:26 <tony2> Dominian: email me offline. I'll recommend places you can try without installing anything
17:40:34 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   and that's a toughie.    How do we break the language barrier if there's just one ambassador in a particular region
17:40:42 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, we have an opensuse google group for India that is a support forum and ambassador forum too
17:40:45 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: sure in that case it isn't needed
17:40:54 <suseROCKs> I guess we need "language ambassadors" in addition to geogrpahical ambassadors
17:41:00 <diamond_gr> Agree on Polo shirt. Ambassadors outfit
17:41:00 <Dominian> tony2: Well, I'm not talking about other software.. just the current stuff that opensuse is utilizing to interact with its user base, ambassadors, marketing etc
17:41:16 <Dominian> http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/PoloShirt
17:41:31 <tony2> jospoortvliet: automatic online translators not sufficient?
17:41:37 <Dominian> ahh
17:41:37 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: eg the brazil team, the greek team, the german team, the dutch team I try to build - the MUST have a ML. THe dutch team now mails with each other in CC but nobody can join that ML and sometimes ppl fall off
17:41:39 <suseROCKs> hey  tshirts and stuff are good to talk about,  but let's focus on the organizational stuff for now
17:41:42 <Dominian> they charge 25Euro for the shirt
17:41:44 <jospoortvliet> tony2: hell no of course not...
17:41:50 <Dominian> suseROCKs: yeah sorry just reading :)
17:42:12 <tony2> Dominian: Agreed. In particular I'm not familiar with Connect, Will follow up on that
17:42:18 <Dominian> same
17:42:21 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: we need an easy way to set up a local ambassador team. opensuse-ambassadors-nl@opensuse.org is what I would love to have. Would make my team building 100x easier
17:42:26 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,    ok  so the 'Main" ambassador list is for the top-level ambassador of a region who then has the responsibility of conveying to smaller groups?
17:42:32 <jospoortvliet> I can point ppl to that, subscribe there and join the conversation
17:42:40 <jospoortvliet> in KDE and GNOME this works often over the translation lists...
17:42:41 <suseROCKs> or rather to regional groups that are language specific?
17:42:42 <Dominian> tony2: I have an account on there, just not sure what use connect is :)
17:42:52 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: something like that, yes
17:43:15 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: I think language specific but eg portugal and brazil want something unique I bet
17:43:19 <diamond_gr> dissagree with opensuse-ambassadors-el mailing list.
17:43:31 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   ok so there's two things then.... a)  ensure there's at least one person who can speak English and b)  how do we know the conveying occurred?    It's silent for us on our end when we don't know activity happens on the other end
17:43:47 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: true, issue
17:43:52 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, exactly
17:43:55 <jospoortvliet> diamond_gr: so you would not want to have a greek ml?
17:44:03 <manugupt1> thats what I am trying to say
17:44:17 <manugupt1> How many of you know that we have an openSUSE India google group
17:44:31 <diamond_gr> we have the simple local mailing list that can we all use. the ambassadors can use the international.
17:44:33 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: manugupt1: make no illusions this IS what happens already. it is why many ambassadors are so quiet - they simply use other channels
17:44:42 <suseROCKs> and if we have one person responsible for conveying between the master and language ML's... we create a potential point of failure too.   But then again, it seems we've got a huge point of failure now to begin with.
17:44:50 <diamond_gr> if they cannot understand english, they can write to theri language.
17:44:53 <jospoortvliet> as the openSUSE infrastructure (a global, english-only ambassador ML is useless for them tot talk to their local team)
17:45:12 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I don't disagree with you.  You're making valid points.    But I'm trying to figure out how we can have better cohesion here.
17:45:15 <jospoortvliet> diamond_gr: so you HAVE a local ml already
17:45:28 <diamond_gr> for some maybe will be just spam.
17:45:29 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, then if we break it down it will more a pita
17:45:31 <suseROCKs> Did lupinstein's rally call get conveyed to the language ml's?
17:45:34 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: well let's just start with building up local teams THEN worry about coordination. We start with 0 remember
17:45:37 <suseROCKs> we dunno
17:45:38 <jospoortvliet> it's a step forward already
17:45:46 <diamond_gr> jospoortvliet, yes, we have.
17:45:49 <manugupt1> We will again have problem's reading MLs
17:45:57 <amonthoth> who is going to monitor every language and region ?
17:45:59 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: well now we simply lost the ppl
17:46:07 <jospoortvliet> amonthoth: nobody as that is impossible.
17:46:14 <lupinstein> ? I think a local ok, but we need first to get everyone to use the tools we have, ppl aren't even doing that
17:46:29 <jospoortvliet> look it is a choice between having good coordination and barely any ambassadors or having strong local communities and ALWAYS having to fight to keep in contact
17:46:32 <jospoortvliet> I rather have the second
17:46:38 <jospoortvliet> so I think we should set up local ML's :D
17:46:44 <amonthoth> that's because ambassador regional mailing list is not practical at all
17:46:52 <lupinstein> you can make all the list you want, but to be honest the ambassador won't use them
17:46:55 <suseROCKs> diamond_gr,  manugupt1  amonthoth    I think jospoortvliet's point is very relevant because our marketing message is shifting from a "we're a great distro" to "we're not just a distro" and if that message isn't consistent, we're wasting our time here strategizing.
17:46:56 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, Ok.. then we will think we have no event reports
17:47:09 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: I want the ambassadors to set up their own if they need it
17:47:29 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: they can be in other languages, they'll have to be anyway.
17:47:30 <tony2> jospoortvliet: I agree decentralization is way to go but there has to be a way for centralized info to be distributed officially
17:47:38 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: you don't realize that most ambassadors don't speak english
17:47:39 <jospoortvliet> seriously
17:47:43 <jospoortvliet> MOST SPEAK NO ENGLISH
17:48:05 <Dominian> Well, why not keep the opensuse-ambassador list for centralizd communication.. then have opensuse-marketing-<lang> for the per language list?
17:48:13 <tigerfoot> vraiment la majoritÃ© n'y comprenne rien :-)
17:48:16 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, ok.. maybe its because of the region
17:48:20 <suseROCKs> Dominian,   that's what jospoortvliet  is saying.
17:48:21 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: yes
17:48:24 <Dominian> suseROCKs: ah
17:48:34 <Dominian> see I'm trying to pay attention to too much again
17:48:38 <jospoortvliet> brazil, NL, germany, greece, actually most of europe works better locla
17:48:39 <lupinstein> jos my point is those that do, don't even use the list
17:48:42 <manugupt1> tigerfoot, lols
17:48:49 <suseROCKs> Dominian,   but I want to ensure that information in a regional ml comes back to the main ml too so we all know about what's going on
17:48:50 <jospoortvliet> I can NOT build a local NL team if I have to tell them to join the international ambassador list
17:48:57 <suseROCKs> cohesion of message is important right now
17:48:57 <Dominian> suseROCKs: ah
17:48:57 <jospoortvliet> so I will need a local ML
17:49:04 <jospoortvliet> and so will everyone for who english is not a normal language
17:49:06 <jospoortvliet> spanish
17:49:07 <jospoortvliet> french
17:49:10 <jospoortvliet> portugese
17:49:11 <jospoortvliet> german
17:49:13 <jospoortvliet> greece
17:49:15 <jospoortvliet> etc
17:49:17 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   now here's another question
17:49:25 <lupinstein> ok, but then how we know they are doing things
17:49:28 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, just create it let it be in hands of whoever wants to create
17:49:32 <manugupt1> it
17:49:37 <Dominian> suseROCKs: You could assign a main ambassador to facilitate management over that regional list and push information to the central mailing list that is important for everyone to know.
17:49:57 <jospoortvliet> lupinstein: we'll loose information and we have to live with that. Of course we should strive to have ppl who coordinate. Eg like Kostas and diamond_gr do for the greece community/tema
17:49:57 <Dominian> or a couple of ambassadors etc
17:49:59 <suseROCKs> we have langauage ml's now, right?  for support and other stuff.    Should we be having -amasasador <lang> list too or just all in one ML?   Keep the noise up on all of them?
17:50:02 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, thats what other communitites hv done specially portuguese and spanish
17:50:04 <jospoortvliet> and carlos and izabel for the brazilians
17:50:07 <tony2> suseROCKs: I disagree. Centralized info should be a single main one way channel to regionals. Info in other direction should be through different individual channels. Thats my IMO
17:50:31 <manugupt1> Ok.. Let me propose something
17:50:34 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: one big ML is a mess
17:50:38 <manugupt1> Lets have a centralised list
17:50:44 <suseROCKs> because even here in marketing, I keep telling people to pay attention to -project and -factory ml's to really kinow the project.    There *has* to be a way to make sure folks understand the overall project and its goings-on
17:50:52 <jospoortvliet> +1
17:51:05 <suseROCKs> those in other languages surely miss out on so much  :-(
17:51:19 <manugupt1> Any language which needs a list can be requested by the admin
17:52:16 <suseROCKs> to the admin  :-)
17:52:21 * bear454 mumbles about how much there is to read on this channel
17:52:35 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, roght
17:52:37 <manugupt1> roght
17:52:39 <manugupt1> right
17:52:46 <diamond_gr> suseROCKs, +1
17:53:44 <tony2> How difficult would it be to request Novell/openSUSE to develop a localization translation package for mailing lists if we don't already do this?
17:53:52 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: ok and if you're an admin for a local language list you MUST be on the ambassador mailinglist
17:54:08 <lupinstein> I can agree with that jos
17:54:15 <suseROCKs> acceptable rule
17:54:17 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, we do not have that HR
17:54:20 <jospoortvliet> tony2: sorry but how interested are you in the discussions around planning of local events around the world? count on 200+ mails per day dude... seriously
17:54:22 <jospoortvliet> you don't want that
17:54:31 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: HR?
17:54:38 <manugupt1> human resources
17:54:52 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I live for the 200+ worldwide plannign mails per day   :-D
17:55:16 <tony2> jospoortvliet: That is why I posted earlier to Bryen that the Centralized Channel should be one way, and upstream info should be separate
17:55:31 <jospoortvliet> tony2: yes, that is not a bad idea
17:56:16 <suseROCKs> tony2,   but at the same time we need the return info so we know things are actually going on.  Especially as Jos and I start to put special focus on regions that are underrepresented
17:56:51 <suseROCKs> we gave special focus to US, Brazil and Greece in the last 6 months and that is returning bountifuls.    Next year, we need to focus on new regions that aren't getting attention
17:57:04 <suseROCKs> how do we know this if there's a language barrier?
17:57:21 <tony2> suseROCKs: I envision proper Collab Tools to do this. So, for instance on typical web based CRMs each Dept/Region/entity would be a child web CRM that can automatically feed to a Parent CRM site
17:57:31 <tigerfoot> :-)
17:57:35 <manugupt1> I suggest we go jos's way and try it out we can always check the aftermath
17:57:48 <suseROCKs> that's a possibility  sure
17:57:57 * tigerfoot predict a fail ... ambassadors will never spend a minute or two to learn how a crm work ...
17:58:00 <manugupt1> I love tony2 now for his wonderful ideas
17:58:04 <suseROCKs> let's give it a shot, tony2    I'd like to see if that helps our long-term planning.  For sure!
17:58:30 * tigerfoot employee do that, but they are paid for doing that, of fired to not do that ....
17:59:04 * manugupt1 thought tigerfoot was self-employed
17:59:12 <tony2> tigerfoot: I have excellent historical experience using DNN on the Microsoft platform, it's very simple for Users who edit site directly. If we need similar I need to find similar running on Linux
17:59:27 <suseROCKs> ok so do we  need to proceed further on this area?   or can we have a focused collaboration on it?   We're already 2 hours into our meeting
17:59:32 <suseROCKs> which is a good thing cuz we clearly had a lot to say
17:59:54 <lupinstein> tigerfoot, I agree on the crm, we can't get 90% to send in a simple report
17:59:58 <suseROCKs> any objections to wrapping up so I can summarize today's discussions and put it on the ML for further feedback?
18:00:16 <manugupt1> I have a few ideas I wanted to discuss
18:00:33 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,    ideas pertaining to our post-mortem?
18:00:43 <manugupt1> No but for the future
18:00:47 <suseROCKs> if not, then it should be part of our regular general meeting
18:00:50 <jospoortvliet> srry lost connection
18:00:52 <jospoortvliet> somehow
18:01:01 <amonthoth> have you tried www.opentaps.org or something similar for crm
18:01:01 <jospoortvliet> what was said after this:
18:01:03 <jospoortvliet> to have a one-way communication to everyone is another way of doing it. So OR you have a moderated ambassador list (only approved messages, one way, to not over-flood the ambassadors) OR you require each local ML to have at least one (or two?) ppl to also be on the international list so they can coordinate
18:01:14 <jospoortvliet> did suseROCKs kick me?
18:01:30 <manugupt1> Ok.. Still I have a thing to say
18:01:32 <tigerfoot> jospoortvliet: yeap wrong button :-)
18:01:35 <jospoortvliet> hehe
18:01:36 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   I would never kick you...
18:01:39 * suseROCKs lies
18:01:44 <diamond_gr> how easy is for the admins to create a tool for us like a blog thing, using <lang>.opensusecommunities.org?
18:01:54 <tony2> amonthoth: Am open to all suggestions. Email me offline and I will eval for Bryen (unless he wants the extra work)
18:02:11 <suseROCKs> diamond_gr,   simply send an email to admin@ and they will respond with what they can do
18:02:15 <suseROCKs> admin@ is your friend
18:02:39 <amonthoth> tony2, oki doki
18:02:53 <manugupt1> And this one is kinda urgent
18:03:10 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,    as you were offline I was saying we've run 2 hours into this meeting and asking if we wanted to wrap up and I'd summarize the discussion and send it to the ML for further feedback
18:03:26 <suseROCKs> and then manugupt1  said  "wait wait, I have a ton of ideas!"  :-)
18:03:30 <jospoortvliet> ok so back to this. Can we tell the ambassadors they can ask admin@ for local ML's in the form of opensuse-ambassador-XX@opensuse.org as long as they have one person on the ambassador ML; or do we go with the other schedule, have a locked ambassador ML which sends mail to all those subteams?
18:03:37 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: aah ok
18:04:33 <manugupt1> anything you guys pick up :)
18:04:34 <suseROCKs> i'm not against continuing the meeting, though I have other things I need to do.    If the feel is hot, go for it and continue talking
18:04:51 <suseROCKs> still waiting for manugupt1  to spill out his ideas
18:04:56 <manugupt1> Ok.. yes
18:04:58 <toratoraman> hi
18:04:58 <manugupt1> I am saying now
18:05:15 <suseROCKs> hello toratoraman   are you the gentleman nmarques just told me about?
18:05:20 <manugupt1> we need a couple of write ups for GSoC within the next 2 days
18:05:34 <manugupt1> That is before 18th
18:05:46 <suseROCKs> define "write ups"
18:06:11 <toratoraman> ok. thank you
18:06:16 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, just that saying we are too excited about it and hope to have a better management / stuff to impress google authorities
18:06:21 <toratoraman> i want send my idea..
18:06:28 <toratoraman> pls.. e-mail adres..?
18:07:01 <manugupt1> What do you guys say about this?
18:07:09 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   no I'm asking what you mean by "write up"   an article?  an email? what?
18:07:16 <manugupt1> An article
18:07:19 <suseROCKs> toratoraman,   are you the one from Turkey?
18:07:21 <manugupt1> on news.opensuse.org
18:07:37 <toratoraman> yes. i m from Turkey
18:08:00 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: if you make a quick draft we'll make it sexy and push it
18:08:02 <jospoortvliet> ok?
18:08:15 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,   no you cannot add my picture to every article!
18:08:27 <manugupt1> jospoortvliet, I will try it
18:08:28 <toratoraman> and i had suse-tr.com web site
18:08:40 <toratoraman> but.. Novell not support for Turkey..
18:08:53 <manugupt1> also I wish to have sometime later an open week
18:08:57 <suseROCKs> guys,  a brief moment please.    nmarques just referred toratoraman to us.  He is a gentleman from Turkey who wishes to represent openSUSE in his country.  Let's welcome him!
18:09:10 <manugupt1> just like the one UBUNTU has
18:09:24 <manugupt1> Hya toratoraman
18:09:34 <amonthoth> wellcome toratoraman !
18:09:52 <toratoraman> thanks..
18:10:12 <tony2> toratoraman: Welcome! Are you saying the Turkish language (localization) or support or Novell/not openSUSE products is missing?
18:10:20 <suseROCKs> toratoraman,  is looking for information on how he can communicate with us and get involved.  Let's give him some information now.
18:10:20 <manugupt1> what do you say?
18:10:55 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,    like the Community Week we used to have  or even the Collaboration Days we have?
18:11:03 <jospoortvliet> manugupt1: just write :D
18:11:46 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   I mean we do have them periodically around here,  but you always say  "like Ubuntu has"  when we have them too.    I'm looking forward to the day when you say "like openSUSE has"  :-D
18:12:14 <toratoraman> Novell does not give support to Turkey. i now using debain. and my team using debian and pardus
18:12:47 <manugupt1> No open week is something where we teach people to use desktop and other noobish stuff
18:12:56 <suseROCKs> toratoraman,   well  Forget about Novell.  We are openSUSE and we have our own support.   If we can help with better support, let us know.  But tell us what specific support you need.
18:13:12 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   again... what we have here from time to time   :-D
18:13:30 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, when did we have it last
18:13:35 <suseROCKs> we haven't had one in about a year I guess, but we have had  yes
18:13:43 <tony2> toratoraman: OK I assume you mean you mean "localization" which means that all components and docs in the Turkish language. Someone should look into that
18:13:51 <manugupt1> I want to revive it
18:14:01 <manugupt1> Who all can help?
18:14:07 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   the biggest trick to arranging that is that most of the people participating are from Novell and thus Novell has to figure out which week to allow people to spend more time on a weeklong event than on their Novell tasks
18:14:36 <suseROCKs> arrrgh  manugupt1   quit saying things like that  :-P    "revive" made it sound like it died.  It never died.  it just happens when there is time availability
18:14:37 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, no It is one hour irc session
18:14:42 <suseROCKs> time to be more positive
18:14:56 <suseROCKs> yes manugupt1   one hour sessions spread out during the week.  That's what we did  :-D
18:15:12 <manugupt1> But we need to forget Novell suseROCKs :)
18:15:15 <suseROCKs> hence why its called "open week"  right?   cuz we have multiple one hour sessions
18:15:47 <suseROCKs> no we don't in this context.  Novell employees have a lot of brainpower that they can help transfer to the community.
18:16:08 <rtyler> AJaeger2: are you going to post something on lizards.o.o about the torrent numbers?
18:16:16 <tony2> toratoraman: Re Turkish language support - You may be right, but if you want me to verify contact me offlist "tonysu@su-networking.com"
18:16:33 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, do not agree we have tony2 tigerfoot the great brains
18:16:42 <manugupt1> yaloki,
18:16:47 <suseROCKs> tony2,     toratoraman  is asking to become an ambassador to help his community get more support within the community
18:17:17 <lupinstein> :-)
18:17:22 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   and all of them can commit time?    you can't guarantee that.   Coordinating times is a hard thing.  Trust me.
18:17:27 <suseROCKs> been there, done that several times
18:17:30 <lupinstein> we have a few ppl that should answer that
18:17:42 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, hmm ok..
18:17:45 <suseROCKs> and oh yeah lupinstein  knows something about Turkey!
18:18:02 <suseROCKs> manugupt1,   regardless  its still a good idea what you want to do.  But not in the context of this meeting
18:18:20 <manugupt1> toratoraman, bhaskar12del might just be visiting turkey during summer
18:18:21 <suseROCKs> and its a "just do it" thing.   If you think it should be done,  start writing up the outline for it and asking people to sign up for it.
18:18:30 <manugupt1> suseROCKs, ok
18:18:49 <suseROCKs> ok guys  anything else?
18:19:04 <tigerfoot> no :-)
18:19:13 <suseROCKs> oh come on tigerfoot
18:19:22 <lupinstein> +1 tigerfoot
18:19:36 <suseROCKs> surely you have a report about SL?
18:19:41 * tigerfoot has a swiss cheese fondue to prepare & is really hungry
18:19:58 <tigerfoot> suseROCKs: rtyler michal carloas, kostas are my writers :-)
18:20:02 <suseROCKs> a fondue with holes in it?
18:20:24 <tigerfoot> and a special report is ongoing ... jospoortvliet will have it tomorrow,
18:20:25 <suseROCKs> ok then I'm going to wrap up if no one says anyting more in the next 30 seconds...
18:20:36 <tigerfoot> then we will tell more about that ..
18:20:39 * manugupt1 blabbers
18:20:40 <tony2> Thx all guys. Good to hear from all of you.
18:20:45 <tigerfoot> 20 sec
18:20:46 <suseROCKs> 15 second warning
18:20:52 <tigerfoot> 10 sec
18:20:57 * lupinstein prays that no talks
18:21:03 <suseROCKs> Thank you all!
