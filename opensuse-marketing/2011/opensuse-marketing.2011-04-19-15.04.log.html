<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> First I want to apologize for the lousy actions regarding team meeting announcements.   I am working on resolving that.
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:06:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We now have all meetings set ahead up to August on openSUSE News calendar
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and vuntz and I just discussed how to get the meetings auto-cron'ed into your mailbox.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So these confusions should end soon.

<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:07:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so after our post-mortem meeting of 11.4 release we agreed taht we wanted to focus on post-mortem assessment of our subset teams, Ambassadors and News
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:07:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bear454, volunteered to run the News team assessment and warlordfff volunteered for the Ambassador team.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Any progress from either of you?
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I made a proposal
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but things went bad and back due to personal and local community needs
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> miaaauw
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> oh a cat
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:09:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> a sec more about the meetings
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I've only gotten 3 responses to my queries to the news group
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:10:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> any idea if you could create a tool which slaps people (me) in the face if they don't show up at a meeting in time?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> should I summarize that or wait ?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,  errr...
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:10:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> we have a ping list for some groups
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> add me there
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:10:58 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">wonders why not everyone jumps on the opportunity to offer him a slap in the face</span>
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:11:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> pay me the fare
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:11:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   the problem is you're saying slap in order to guilt someone into not going to meetings.  Yet I have a feeling you live for slaps and might miss meetings just to get a slap
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:11:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> lol
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:11:17 </span><span class="nka">* warlordfff</span> <span class="ac">slaps jospoortvliet in the face</span>
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> happy now punk ? ;-)
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:11:36 </span><span class="nka">* jospoortvliet</span> <span class="ac">is relieved. the world is still normal</span>
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:11:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> me and normal?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> apologies for taking the discussion oftoppic. bear454 and warlordfff sorry too
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no one's normal in this team
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:12:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and none of us want to be normal!
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> thank god
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok first bear454  then warlordfff ....
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bear454,   Do you think there's enough on the survey you did to build up on where we can improve on news organization?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> With 3 responses, I'd have to say the biggest issue is apathy
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:13:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think we're starting to lose our direction on the news team and we need to look at what we can do to get back on track before it becomes permanent
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:13:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I have a suggestion to make here
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:13:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Can I?
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:13:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> I'll summarize the few responses and make some suggestions
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> in email
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:14:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1 ?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:14:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. I think the major differnece between pre 11.4 and post 11.4 is we do not know what to write on
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Even before 11.4 release we had a lot of articles not completed but we always knew that there is something to write upon
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> .
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:15:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   I think you just nailed part of the problem within your statement itself...    By referring to pre-post 11.4.  When news.o.o should not be focused on just distro news.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:15:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I agree on that myself
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:15:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Now we do not have a clue whats going in the factory adn we still have time for that
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and yes it is true that we tend to be more active just before the next distro release and we need to iron that out so we're at high motivation regardless of release schedule
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:16:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> OBS no new releases
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:16:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think we have a creativity crisis
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:16:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> That is what I am trying to say
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is not bad
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:16:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I do have one thing to add that I planned to mention in the Events topic, but its relevant here.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:16:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> My suggestion is lets make a list of news articles
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> to be published in the coming month
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> my suggestion is to relax
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We are not doing a good job at ALL of promoting events that we are going to.     I've got a tentative article already drafted for LFNW next week which bear454 needs to review/approve
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:17:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> guys
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:17:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we need more.   for example, warlordfff has a lot of events going on in Greece.  We need to mention that on news
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I approve; just haven't finished the art
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:17:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> bear  ok.  Let's get that out the door by end of week if possible?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bear454&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   that's the scheduling page we have on our os-news pad site
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but seems no one is following it lately.    and newcomers aren't following the protocols we set up recently either.  But I don't want to clamp down too much on newcomers
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:19:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So whats the solution to it
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:19:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so bear454   we need to continue to figure out more on what we can do for  news.o.o.     Now moving on to warlordfff's Ambassador assessment
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:19:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well I made a looong proposal
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:20:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:20:26 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">slaps jospoortvliet 1) for the heck of it and 2) cuz he's silent.  Just cuz he's here doesn't mean he gets to be silent</span>
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> then jospoortvliet slaped me back to reality
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:20:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> to summarise what I got from all this
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> although i am a bit stoned from the drugs I take
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that never stopped the rest of us  :-)
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:21:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> +1 suseROCKs
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:21:41 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">lights up so warlordfff doesn't feel alone</span>
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think we should not make anything for the ambassador program for now
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:21:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:22:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oh crap, this is logged.   Some googler is going to think I really am a pothead...     DELETE  DELETE!!!
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> please let me finish all my thought
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:22:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:23:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we must organize an ambassador colaboration day in the next few months and one of the purposes will be to resolve that
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:23:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so it is better
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> to
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:24:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> talk about collaboration day  now and talk about improvement of the ambassador program there
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:24:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> finished
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:24:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hmm
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think ;-)
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:24:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> may I speak now?  :-)
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:24:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:24:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. I have a couple of things to add to after war lord :D and suseROCKs
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:24:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  thanks for that warlordfff  and I look forward to the results of such a collaboration meeting... however...
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the point of the assessment was that it was the result of the postmortem of the marketing team's 11.4 release.    So...  as we're now 1 1/2 months since release...  we still don't see the important questions asked...
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> such as:   What did the ambassadors do well in this release?  What didn't we do well on?    Did we have enough launch parties?  If not, why?  etc.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:25:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ???
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> easy
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:26:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we need to be able to see what worked and what didn't work so that we're better prepared in 12.1 planning cycle
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:26:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have th answers to that
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:27:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I was heading somewhere else
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:27:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the fact is that only a few titled ambassadors actually worked
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:28:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but it went well
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:28:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we never have such thing as enough launch parties
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well that's what we need to figure out.  Why only a few?   I think we had fewer launch parties than before.  But that's just a perception guesstimate on my part.  No real data
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:29:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think so too but we still have enough time for that
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:29:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have at least one more planned
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:29:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 to no such thing as "enough launch parties"    Good attitude to say that.  But we don't want too few either  :-)
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:29:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> of course we do\
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:30:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> please give me some time
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:30:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well warlordfff   can you help us to pull real data together so we can accurately plan better for it in the 12.1 cycle?
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:30:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I am trying to find something to motivate people to do more parties
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">15:30:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you have time  :-)   But I don't want to miss the opportunities  :-)
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:30:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> whaat do you mean by that?
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what I mean is in 11.4 cycle, we did a bad job of scheduling tasks ahead of time and we ended up in serious crunch at the last minute.
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I mean what opportunities you think we lost?
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I want to make sure we don't forget the lessons we learned in 11.4 before we put it to a real schedule in 12.1 as we agreed in the post-mortem meeting
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I slightly dissagree on that
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:32:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> because?
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">15:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not the last you said
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I would say, we have a plan already, we just have to try and follow it for the next release :D
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think we had bad organization but we did not lost anything
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> +1
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:33:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I am there too
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:33:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we still learn
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:33:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,    really?  A lot of people lost a lot of sleep in the last week.   That was never happened before and we need to avoid that next time so that so many people don't burn out easily
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">15:33:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ???
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I still don't get you
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   weren't you here in the channel during the last week before 11.4 release?  many of us slept only a very few hours trying to finish up everything
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:34:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> me too
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:34:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we were here together
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:34:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> sure but I think the major issues were: lack of experience and late start. we can surely do better this time - it's just a matter of DOING so (follow the planning) - discussing doesn't help I think
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:34:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Agreed on that and we all do not want to repeat it
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:34:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Exactly Jos
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:34:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:35:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we agree on that
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> All releases mean less sleep - nothing new on my side ;/
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:35:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> where I dissagree
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:35:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> is
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:35:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that we lost opportunities
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:35:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> only there
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:35:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so that's the point of the assessment warlordfff   so we can record where we lost things so we don't forget about them next time around  :-)
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:36:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if we pretend to not learn from lessons of the past, how can we be better next time around?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:36:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> of course we made mistakes
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> well warlordfff is probably saying that we did about 99% of what we should do for a good release. The work we did was awesome imho. We could've done some things earlier but I see little area's were we didn't do anything
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:36:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but I say it is ok
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   so are you saying we should not record what we did well and what we didn't do well?
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:37:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Me too for this release but what I would like to see a continued momentum which is what suseROCKs is trying to say I believe
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:37:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  pause man

<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:39:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so how do we learn from our mistakes if we don't record them anywhere?   That's what I'm trying to understand here
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:39:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no I don't disagree with you.  I'm just asking where is the data  :-)

<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">15:43:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> as simple as that I believe
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">15:43:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's the assessment i"m looking for  :-)   And in format that tony__ just suggested is good too

<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">15:44:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> a question
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">15:44:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> it certainly is not but will give a list of pros and cons

<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">15:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> do you dissagree that is too early to jump into conclutions?
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">15:44:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no I don't.
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">15:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Only other suggestion is that any dirty laundry be posted in a &lt;private&gt; blog/location
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">15:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> No but I agree that its time we start preapring for 12.1
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">15:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span>  +1
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:45:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we started the next day of 11.4

<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">15:45:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:45:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> so what I see here is after 11.4 we lost a momentum because we were all tired suseROCKs does want that to happen
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:46:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we promote 11.4 so that 12.1 will b even better promoted
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok warlordfff   so when do you think is the right time to assess the ambassador performance of 11.4 release day?
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> warlordfff do you agree on my proposal
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">15:46:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  I don't think anyone disagrees on that.    the difference here is "when"  not "if"
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">15:46:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">15:47:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> now

<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">15:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   ok  but let's move on quickly as we have other topics and we spent too much time on this one
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">15:48:11 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">see AJ has clones, that's good for us :-)</span>
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">15:48:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> why do you want to assess the ambassador performance? what do you think we can achieve with that?
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">15:48:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> tell me that please
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">15:48:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> uhhh  didn't we just cover all that?

<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">15:49:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:49:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> look  as I said a few lines ago,  if you think now is not the time to assess the 11.4 release day related to ambassadors  then fine,  but give an approximate date when that will be
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:50:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as you volunteered to do the assessment in March so that's why its an item here on the agenda.  But if you feel it needs to be postponed, then fine.
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:50:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I answered that in my first lines about that man
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:50:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then we drop the assessment for now until a time when you feel it is appropriate.  That's all.
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:51:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> untill the collaboration day
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:51:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But suseROCKs there are2 action items
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we agreed on that right?
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:51:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> One you asses our mistakes during the launch and the other warlordfff assesses what we learnt
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">15:52:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   not "mistakes"  but "what we did well and didn't do well"
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">15:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I don't get what you want, really guys
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">15:52:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we can drop that asessment and just focus on collaboration day sometime in the future.

<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">15:56:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> At the moment am learning more about current openSUSE testing tools and procedures before deciding exactly how to present to prospective testors
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">15:56:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> Too early to analyze current practices
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">15:56:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tony__:</span> make sure to improve any documentation you bump into. That means that whatever happens, you're time will have been valuable... ;-)
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:56:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> But if we want more, I can always move forward but currently am not sure exactly how to present to prospects
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:56:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> even if you have to drop this due to eg real life time constraints or something else in the future...
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">15:57:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's really all we need to do from the marketing perspective of attracting testers.   Good documentation.  Perhaps a good screencast about how to set up vm so you can test on your local machine, etc.
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:58:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Will concentrate on that, but it's still too early to define exactly how/what to test once setup, and setup can be important how setup
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well  can I ask what you mean by "how/what to test"?
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:59:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> maybe we're overcomplicating that part
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:59:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I'll promise something more definite to report on by next month
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:59:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> "How to Test" is still an unknown to me, EFFECTIVE testing isn't just setting up and doing "something"
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">16:00:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Recommend tabling until next month. I'll promise more
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">16:00:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tony__,   but the "doing something" is one of the main things we want.  isn't it?    It's pretty hard to define exactly what to test for since we provide sooo many things out of the box
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">16:00:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Connectivity in the underground sucks:-(
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">16:01:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I've done alot of testing and IMO ineffective testing isn't that useful. we need to get max bang for buck (time spent)
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:03:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,  are you actually away or here?

The comment I hear most from packagers is  "well we didn't hear any complaints on bugzilla about it and so we assumed it just worked"

<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">16:24:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> are you guys willing to stick around for another 1/2 hour or should we wrap up and continue discussion of the two remaining topics on ML?
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">16:25:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> finish it fast

<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">16:25:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the two remaining topics are Collaboration Day and Marketing/Artwork Materials.   Neither of them are quick subjects.

<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">16:26:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> leave them for the next meeting
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">16:26:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no  next meeting isn't for another month.   That's what ML's are for  :-D

<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">16:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so let's go ahead and wrap up so AJaeger can be with his family and so jospoortvliet doesn't get slapped too much (cuz I think it turned him on too much)
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">16:27:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> :D

<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:30:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what is the goal?
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> And I think there should be a vote on wallpapers and splash. There are comments even in the Tech forums about the 11.4 splash

<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:31:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Please no votes for artwork
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok manugupt1   so you feel we should do this...  Do you accept the action item to lead this initiative?
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:32:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Just saying it's not any one's imagination, even new users are dissing

<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:32:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  well more than that, don't you think?
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:32:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> like, where to gather and store the wallpapers, etc.
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:33:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Thats the first thing
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:33:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm all for it, because we may discover a hidden gem of an artist out there and we *need* more artists!
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:33:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but...  who leads this?   manugupt1?
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tony__&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Bryen, we should take followup offline, but I'm aghast how we're not storing all proprietary openSUSE stuff on Novell servers only
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> remember we have a flickr group
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> What do you say?
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">16:34:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> well yes, we can use the flickr group
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   but flickr doesn't store high-quality does it?
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:34:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> in general, I'm OK with doing it to get attention, but it can't decide on what we ship
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:34:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that'll be up to our artists
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">16:34:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> imho
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> it stores suseROCKs
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">16:35:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,  well if you think that's the place to use, then go for it.  I'm trying to put you in charge here   :-D
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">16:35:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and in charge means you are responsible for determinging best approaches
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">16:35:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So the thing is we need to follow up with artwork team first
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">16:36:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok now I'm confused again  :-D
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">16:36:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> are we doing this to gather up a large collection of openSUSE wallpapers for our users to choose from,  or are we looking for a way to find the default wallpaper?
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">16:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> If its the artwork team's discretion at the end we should have a consensus with them
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">16:36:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Collection in the distribution for a change
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">16:36:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> for a collection, we don't need artist approval, I don't think
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">16:37:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Lets see how it goes
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">16:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well... accept the action item already then  :-D
