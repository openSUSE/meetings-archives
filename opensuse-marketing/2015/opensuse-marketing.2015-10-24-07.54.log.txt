08:09:03 <ddemaio> Go about your day and join in and contribute how you want
08:33:50 <eiosifidis> ddemaio, ping
08:34:02 <ddemaio> hi eiosifidis
08:34:18 <eiosifidis> Regarding the Enlightenment screens
08:34:24 <ddemaio> yes
08:34:24 <eiosifidis> they are the same as 13.2
08:34:41 <eiosifidis> I installed Enlightenment and the branding was the same as 13.2
08:34:56 <ddemaio> hum
08:35:19 <eiosifidis> The only think we can do, I guess, is to change the background and take the pictures.
08:35:34 <ddemaio> I guess that will do
08:36:10 <eiosifidis> I'll try to have them by the end of the weekend.
08:36:20 <eiosifidis> And I'll search for the features.
08:37:07 <eiosifidis> Regarding GNOME features, do you want a brief description or is this fine?
08:37:25 <ddemaio> Ok. thank you. Did you email the factory list about the branding issue in Englightenment
08:38:03 <eiosifidis> I did directly to Simotek. #opensuse-e
08:38:31 <eiosifidis> Simotek and Sleep-walker are the main guys to ping.
08:39:24 <ddemaio> ok. I think the features are fine, but a brief description would probably be been
11:02:27 <diamond_gr> ddemaio: the enlightenment guys (Simotek) told me that the branding is in staging. He'll take some screens by tomorrow and he'll add the features.
11:03:25 <ddemaio> diamond_gr: ok. thank you for the update
12:12:41 <victorhck> back later....
14:29:50 <undefined_> hello

15:54:37 * victorhck don't know where to start!!
16:07:53 <eiosifidis> ddemaio, victorhck the splash screen when booting the installed system missing. Couldn't take one on virtual box. Actually it's too small and not centered.
16:08:27 <victorhck> and in openqa?
16:08:47 <eiosifidis> didn't check there.
16:09:00 <victorhck> in openqa there are screenshots...
16:09:10 <victorhck> https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/95266/modules/gimp/steps/12
16:09:18 <victorhck> ^ for example...
16:10:28 <eiosifidis> nope, it's not what I search. I'll continue on that. thanks
16:13:51 <eiosifidis> This is the image http://susepaste.org/96815820
16:48:27 <victorhck> there are some task or some ToDo list or something like that?
17:24:29 <victorhck> what's GIMP version in Leap ??
17:26:25 <victorhck> and Inkscape??
18:11:31 <eiosifidis> victorhck, I think the features page has a section about applications. Add there the versions of such applications.
