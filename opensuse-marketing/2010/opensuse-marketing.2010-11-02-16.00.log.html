<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:06:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:06:11 </span><span class="nka">* yaloki</span> <span class="ac">seconds that</span>
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> ack
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:06:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> yeah, seriously... that dude just won't...
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> why I always highlighted?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sshaw&gt;</span> oh he's in here isn't he :)
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:06:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sshaw:</span> :D
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:06:39 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">wakes up</span>
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so several of us managed to find time to have a Marketing BoF.  Although the BoF itself was way too short so all we could really focus on was listing what our priorities are for the coming year
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:06:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> yeah I heard rumors that yaloki talked a lot
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:07:23 </span><span class="nka">* simon123</span> <span class="ac">can't find video about yaloki's talk</span>
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:07:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we *think* he was talking, but we're not sure  :-)
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">16:07:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> there were no videos... *shrug*
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">16:07:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so here  without further ado are the list of priorities in no particular order....
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">16:08:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Artwork (which Gnokii will handle in terms of corporate branding)
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">16:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> second artwork prioritiy also is what do we, marketing team need for artwork
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">16:08:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Branding Consistency
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">16:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> next priority was deterimining what we need for Materials.   How do we do better job of organizing and providing a-z as much as possible materials
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">16:09:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> next...  Improving Ambassador Visibility
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">16:09:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Next...  Buidling up a Writers Brigade
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">16:09:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> next...  gnokii also wants us to consider slogan
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">16:10:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and another final one on my list is support services (making sure we, the marketing team, provide the ambassadors with what they need)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">16:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> the slogan its fine with me, but u should not come up with an new one !
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">16:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its on the list cuz you wanted to talk about it.  but we can cross off  :-)
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">16:11:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well IIRC the slogan was voted for a while ago, maybe worth reconsidering
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">16:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I should note that many of these priorities are contingent on our final strategy statement for openSUSE.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">16:11:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> also in order to have something aligned with the strategy :D
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">16:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> +1
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">16:11:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> hey +1 me... I said it first!  ;-D
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">16:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but indeed, once we have something, we need to stick with it for a while
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">16:12:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> that's quite obvious :)
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">16:12:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so...  does anyone want to add to the list of priorities?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">16:12:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> http://typewith.me/pE9agOfff1
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">16:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> team + communication ?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">16:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> making sure that we have communication channels to everyone
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">16:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ahh yes,  the liaison stuff
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">16:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> at least I remembered also having mentioned that the initial idea with ambassadors was to have local contacts to centralize and translate requests e.g. for DVDs and such
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">16:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so  first one is artwork... branding, etc.    gnokii   You were going to meet with Nuno on Saturday.   Did you get anything useful there?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">16:14:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I did what?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">16:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Don't you remember?  At the artwork BoF, Nuno offered to meet with you on Saturday (last day)?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">16:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> artwork - where do we organize colaboration ? where we upload files?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">16:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> sorry but Nuno made a little bit a kind of workshop with javier, but I found that for me not useful ;)
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">16:15:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">16:15:44 </span><span class="nka">* gnokii</span> <span class="ac">one artist princess (me) for a project is already enough</span>
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">16:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> artwork - where do we organize colaboration ? where we upload files?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">16:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> simon123,   good question.   can you elaborate on what you see would work well for you?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">16:16:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> wait
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">16:16:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> wait
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">16:16:19 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">waits</span>
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">16:16:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> wait
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">16:16:28 </span><span class="nka">* simon123</span> <span class="ac">too</span>
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">16:16:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> deadlock! :D
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">16:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> talked with prusnak he take a look after mizmos DesignHub she makes for gnome
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">16:17:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> I defintly not plan to upload design stuff to the wiki
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">16:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so u happy?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">16:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is this DesignHub easy for non-technical users to grab artwork?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">16:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> e.g., avoiding git usage, etc.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">16:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> I'm not sure why I would be happy or not - the queation was where is the place to upload show cases and ideas - images
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">16:18:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I think collaboration tools is one of top 3 priorities
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">16:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> DesignHub its for sharing ideas made
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">16:19:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well I gues gnokii  answered that question to some extent.   What is prusnak's answer about implementation?
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">16:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> http://live.gnome.org/UsabilityProject/Whiteboard/DesignHub
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">16:20:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure, but are we going to implement it or is it still being thought about for our own infrastructure?
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">16:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> remind him a few days after conf, he said it is on his todo list
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">16:21:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but that's just a wiki page, isn't it ?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">16:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">16:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ah, no, okay
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">16:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we can revisit artwork collaboration and branding at a later time
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">16:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but it's just mockups
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">16:22:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> yaloki there is a implementation
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">16:22:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> just as a reminder, folks.  When I'm talking about artwork, I'm only speaking in the marketing area.   Artwork/Gnokii is a much more broader topic for him to push
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">16:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so let's revisit that when things are in place... and move on to the nest one....
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">16:23:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ambassadors - Organization, visibility, communication
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">16:24:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> as yaloki mentioned, we'd like to try to centralize communication in particular regions where there are many
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">16:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">16:24:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> This will help reduce some language barriers, and speed up delivery of materials
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">16:24:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and also helps to ensure there is consistent messaging from all of our ambassadors, cuz we don't know everyone and what they're saying out there.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">16:25:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,  izabelvalverde any thoughts on improving based on your experiences with the large Brazilian team?
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">16:25:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm not looking for just answers, I'm looking for also existing issues we need to address
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">16:25:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> better CarlosRibeiro answer that
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">16:25:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> Yes have are having some improvement
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">16:26:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, to put it simply, those who can send out material at novell or open-slx do not speak spanish, russian, etc...
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">16:26:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> but as we do not fisinsh our firstphase of ourr taskks that will be ending at latinoware
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">16:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and I know that at least some time ago, the former community manager received a lot of requests in non-english languages
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">16:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> wait a minute, the brazilian team isnt large, when we do the thing we spoke about in the BoF session
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">16:26:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> then I believe that now is not the best tim to  do it
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">16:26:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> but in genereal results.... we are growing in quality
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">16:27:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   I'm asking for their opinion here and now because they're here.   And I think 14 is a good number
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">16:27:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> numbers of ambassadors
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">16:27:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> and spread the team in one per states at minimum
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">16:27:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   slow down a bit...  the question is more about  what breakdowns or weaknesses can we improve from marketing team to supply to ambassadors?
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">16:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> how do we improve there?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">16:27:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> that make us abe to know everything that is happeing in remotes areas inside brasil
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">16:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> first with consistent meetings during 2 months
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">16:28:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> makes a lot of diffirence for us
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">16:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   meetings with the marketing team?
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> suseROCKs I believe garantee marketing materials is the first step
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we really learned how to help each other working in a collaborative way
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">16:28:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> izabelvalverde,   point taken
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we had opensuse-pt meetings
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,    slow down.   I'm not asking how things are within the Ambassador team.  We are asking,  what does marketing team need to do to work better with ambassador team
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">16:29:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> most focused on marketing, sure but not only about mkt
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">16:30:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I count only 10 in Brazil because such like izabelvalverde be deleted next time!
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">16:30:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> why would we delete izabelvalverde?
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">16:30:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> why?
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">16:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> gnokii don't be mad!
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">16:30:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> because I do not make ur personal page on the wiki with contact data ;)
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">16:31:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> -i + you
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">16:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> ok... I'll work on it ;)
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">16:31:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">izabelvalverde:</span> please do :)
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">16:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but we know she's here and we know she's active.  She's been very swamped lately with organizing the Ambassadors for the upcoming Ambassador meeting next week.   Give her some credit  :-)
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">16:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I think ambassadors needs to fell more closer if marketing team
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">16:32:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's important to show faces, us being human and all :)
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">16:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> lowers the barrier a bit for people to get in touch with us
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">16:32:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki, human?   :-)
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">16:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> there is no discussion! plz because one excuse makes a lot of discussions with others!
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">16:32:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, not me, I'm not, but.. :)
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">16:32:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I mean... In brazil we have some ambassadors that believes that we guys from marketing team are like
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">16:32:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> untouceble
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">16:32:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah yeah the demigods thingy
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">16:33:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I see, CarlosRibeiro.  So the ambassadors feel we're unfriendly?
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">16:33:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> mm..
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">16:33:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> not the same thing
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">16:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> not approachable :)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">16:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> then this makes a better relationship/ collaboration , integration litle harder
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:33:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">16:33:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's an interesting challenge though, when you think about it....
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">16:33:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> On the one hand, marketing team should be wholly approachable.
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">16:34:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  no, it's not what I mean
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">16:34:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> On the other hand, marketing team shouldn't have to reach out to all the markets, that's what the regional ambassador leads are for.
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">16:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> they like mkt team, they respect
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">16:35:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> but they fell they are not closerr that they may like to be
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">16:35:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I find it always intersting to speak in the name of ambassadors
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">16:35:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> yeah, that's a problem we have at all levels in the project
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">16:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> but in the other way
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">16:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> clearly something we need to fix, but it's difficult, it's also a cultural issue
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">16:35:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   could part of the problem be language barriers?   I'm curious and want to explore this further on the side
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">16:36:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> the ambasadors video works wonderfull, i mean,
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">16:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> the feedback was great
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">16:36:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> when we have time for a stupid question plz let me know :)
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">16:36:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we need to be creative and create more things to  make possible to ambassadors intereact with each other
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">16:36:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">16:37:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  that's what izabelvalverde mentioned earlier and that is so duly noted
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">16:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> how about ambassador meetings ?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">16:37:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info  </span><span class="cmdline">Need more marketing materials to supply to Ambassadors</span>
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">16:37:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> that are things we had
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">16:37:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">16:37:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> I mean on a regular basis
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">16:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> maybe all ambassadors during meetings and speech creates a kind of remote connectoin  to allow others ambaassadors to see, to learn, to improve, to give feedback
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">16:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> what do u for infos?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">16:37:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   we've done that once earlier this year and it was good  But incredibly arduous to find a nice global time  :-)
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">16:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> although it must be really tricky with language and timezones :\
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">16:38:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">16:38:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> yes
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">16:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can u take it plz back?
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">16:38:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> and getting to know each other a little bit
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">16:38:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> can I share a couple of thoughts ?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">16:38:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Why?
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">16:38:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> yes, this is really important, we need to know that names and nicks have faces and sould
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">16:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> soul
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">16:39:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> +1
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">16:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, passion :)
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">16:39:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> because as there was a call which ambassador needs a package with material last time there wasnt a lot of resposne
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">16:39:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> that just means we don't know yet :)
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">16:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> Maybe for the next conference we can start to think to haveAmbassadors meeting toguether
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">16:39:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   it still should be listed as #info that we have a record that we *need* to do this
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">16:39:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> maybe one day before or after the conference
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">16:39:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> I like that
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">16:39:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> either as package kit or as resources on the web
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">16:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Not every ambassador canattend the conference even though we like it
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">16:40:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">16:40:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Too far too expensive for lots
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">16:40:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> mmh there was always no problem when material was needed, to say it to AJ or michl and they send it, its only possible to do it with some time
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">16:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> something we hope to address with funding next year
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">16:40:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span>  if they will not be able to physically join
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">16:41:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> they (we) must be able to be part at least virtually
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">16:41:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> mind if the bureaucrats step in ?
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">16:41:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   material isn't just about physical stuff.  Material also includes, slide presentation templates, logos, talking points, etc. etc.    We need to do better job organizing it so no one has to look all over for it.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">16:41:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> cause I do have a couple of questions
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">16:41:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> 1. how do we measure Ambassadors success (its from that point that marketing should provide the assistance)
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">16:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> who's the bureaucrat?
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">16:42:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we need to start to think about that - ambassadors needs to be clever, smart, and work with passion - then we need to find a way to make us even closer
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">16:42:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> then u should begin to talk abotu the typewith.me points before that point is done I cant do such stuff!
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">16:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> 2. we need probably formal communication (general) and then let have the ambassadors to do local changes required so we don't offende the audiences
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">16:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we have technology for that :D  I'm not sure where but we have
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">16:42:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> as it's pretty much clear that people throughout the world have different visions about our message and ourselfs
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">16:43:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> +1
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">16:43:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> I think we can only act, after we know how we can measure success and what is going good or bad
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">16:43:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,  answer to 1.   Measurement of success is based on visibility.  Not any specific metric at this time, but based on getting ambassadors out there and reporting back.   That's the sole specific main priority of all ambassadors
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">16:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we are too far from each other
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">16:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> :(
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">16:43:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, if it's for visibility
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">16:43:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we're not helping
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">16:44:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I defend since day one that all active ambassadors should have at least a @o.o
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">16:44:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, that's credibility
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">16:44:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> chicken/egg
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">16:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> yaloki, we have to risk it man
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">16:44:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we're back to the chicken/egg problem with ambassadors
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">16:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> aaaaaaaaargh, why there ist always that stupid als should have that
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">16:44:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> ?
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">16:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> nmarques, I would not prefer that
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">16:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> fedora removed that right and they did it not without a purpose
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">16:45:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> hm, no, I don't think so
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">16:45:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, we are not Fedora
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">16:45:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> mail@o.o
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">16:45:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> then make an alternative
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">16:45:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> like
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">16:45:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> for what?
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">16:45:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   we did discuss that during our BoF.   and while I know it does help to boost "superficial" credibility, it doesn't instill credibility.  I don't use aliases and I get called on to talk to people lots.
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">16:45:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> user@ambassadors.opensuse.org
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">16:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> sorry but using @o.o makes you representative of the project, whether you like it or not, willingly or not
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">16:45:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> one think that I believe we are doing well is working or try to work more closer with the " decision makers"
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">16:45:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> yaloki, +1
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">16:45:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> yaloki, and ambassadors are what? they stand for what ?
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">16:46:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> its more about how you effectively present yourself.   Making a strong presence in your words and demonstrations.   The alias stuff will follow suit.  That's just my opinion though
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">16:46:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> yaloki, the project? no?
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">16:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> well, not yet at this point :)
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">16:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ambassadors who have proven to be actively contributing to the project can apply for membership and will become members
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">16:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> ok, then we make it simple an ambassador have to be member of the project good by CarlosRibeiro and nmarques
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">16:46:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and then have the email
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">16:46:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I mean, bring to our side, some influence professor at school or university that we are doing speech
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">16:46:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, makes all sense to me
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">16:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> ???
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">16:47:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, that raises another question... we need to provide a small training brainstorm to help them becoming members :)
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">16:47:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> with all due respect, I'm all for giving much more visibility to ambassadors and all that
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">16:47:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> ok, I really hate coming in the middle of talks, what are you guys talking about
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">16:47:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   aren't your words at events more powerful than an email address on a little piece of paper?
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">16:47:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> lupinstein,  we're talking about all the priorities we brought up at the oSC Marketing BoF
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">16:47:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> don't know
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">16:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, indeed, but to gather resources for an event you need more credibility
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">16:48:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">16:48:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> dont know, but always crying for a thing before knowing its really needed
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">16:48:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I agree suseROCKs during my last talk the only issue I faced was not doing an install fest people have nicknamed me SUSE over here
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">16:48:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> lupinstein,  and specifically this topic is about what do ambassadors need to do their jobs.  And we're back to the age old alias issue again
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">16:48:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> :)
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">16:48:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> guys it«'s just my thought
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">16:48:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> ambassadors should be empowered
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">16:48:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there you go manugupt1 ... you made presence!   Good job, man!
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">16:48:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> let's move on to another point
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">16:49:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> if they are not doing their stuff, we remove it
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">16:49:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,  +1
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">16:49:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> once they do something for the project, they will be a member, etc..
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">16:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;simon123&gt;</span> giving email alias is a problem if we have no way to take it away
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">16:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> but then again, how can we ask someone to contribute for us and not empower them to do such ?
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">16:49:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but just writing your name on a wiki page doesn't make you a contributor just yet ;)
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:49:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> nmarques,  right its hard to get recognition but spoken in the right way people do recognize
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">16:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> anyway, let's move on or we'll spend an hour on this :)
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">16:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> well could I give another cent as how to improve our visibility with quality
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">16:49:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> what did u do until yet for oS?
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">16:49:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> please do :)
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">16:49:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> last one
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">16:50:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so we covered artwork, we covered ambassadors, we should talk about materials now
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">16:50:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, I am not am ambassador, but I maintain a couple of packages for GNOME:Apps
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">16:50:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> oh I meant: let's stick with the visibility topic, but let's move beyond the email address thing
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">16:50:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I'm figure out master pupets of several project like gimp, blender, cinelerra
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">16:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, but I never applied for membership because I don't need the email :)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">16:50:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so why u then talking about?
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">16:50:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> local ones, like brasilian references for xen, gimp, inkscape
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">16:50:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> yes because u have a fedora address
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">16:50:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> blahblahblha, then I start to convert this guys
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">16:50:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> that would be mostly translations, right ?
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">16:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> showing why not use blender under SUSE
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">16:50:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> is much better
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">16:51:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> the results are so nice
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">16:51:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> gnokii, some people specially students feel that they need to have official recognization because elders wont thing them as a kid also that might put weight on their cv
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">16:51:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> what sort of audience are you talking about?
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">16:51:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> because they already had their people that follow them
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">16:52:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, my account on fedora is inactive
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">16:52:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   Those are "talking points'  and if we have reason to demonstrate why for example Blender works better on openSUSE, then it should be listed on talking points page
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">16:52:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I'm talking about desing, but this example could be done and possible with any segment or auience
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">16:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> sorry but I give a shit about the "feel" whens really needed then we find a solution
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">16:52:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, so I don't have the @fedoraproject.org active
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">16:52:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> Well, to to stir things up, but I think we need people to host parties, request and give aways DVD, be more active on opensuse mailing list/forums answer and helps, twit, blog and write. Kits would be nice, but lets be real, we don't have money to create kits. At least the Ambassador could get a shirt.
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">16:52:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, I never actually used it :)
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">16:52:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> but for a "feel" definitly not
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">16:52:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> language, please
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:52:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> guys, blender, inkscape, audience ... thiss is not the case, not what really matter
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">16:52:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> not _yet_ ;)
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">16:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> what I trying to say is that if we find good references in other areas
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">16:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> by shirt, I mean the one we already have printed.
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">16:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> our mission to gain visibility, quality and achieve our goals could be much easier
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">16:53:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I was talking about budget
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">16:53:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">16:54:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> we have a budget or we are getting a budget?
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:54:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're kissing up to *get* a budget  :-)
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we will most probably having a budget with the foundation
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:54:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> s/having/have/
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:54:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> it's still a moving target though, but it's not unlikely at all
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">16:54:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. I have an idea tshirts / shirt desgns to at the artwork portal or somewhere

<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">16:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> we're going everywhere right now :)

<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">16:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> and what benefits are we taking from it ?
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">16:55:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we're all over the place now...  let's pull back
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">16:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, what feedback do we get from handling such things ?
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">16:55:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> one thing at a time please :)
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">16:55:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> because if we don't know that, we will never be able to pull a budget :)

<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">17:01:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Activists?   Nah,  that's not what they do.   They're not all a bunch of hippies.
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">17:01:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> nice to see you back
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">17:01:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But let's not do the naming thing in this meeting.  We can talk about that directly in an Ambassador meeting
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">17:01:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> an activist is someone which organizes activities
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">17:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">17:02:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> next steps?
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">17:02:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> like campus workshops, install fests and stuff :)

<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">17:02:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> folks, we really have to get to a point where we can focus on specific items in a meeting
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">17:02:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;amonthoth&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> hello
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">17:02:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> welcome to marketing meeting
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">17:02:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yeah yaloki.   Everyone wants to talk like a broken egg.  :-)
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">17:02:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> during this meeting, we've been discussing into every single direction, which is understandable because there is so much stuff to talk about and work on
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">17:03:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but the result is: no result at all
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">17:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So, as I've said now for the umpteenth time...  Ambassador topic is done.
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">17:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> +1 I said that thousand times before
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">17:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  _1 next?
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">17:03:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> More can be discussed on specific details of Ambassador needs in an Ambassador meeting
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">17:03:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> okay, probably not a bad idea
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">17:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Next priority to discuss (15 minute limit!!!!!)  is materials and resource access
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">17:04:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> until the foundation has a budget, material and resources are pretty much limited to electronic stuff
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">17:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well, and sending out DVDs
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">17:04:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Where do we feel is our accessibility to the materials we have.  Do we have enough, what can we build up more on (e.g. more slideshows?) etc.
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">17:04:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> so, do we already know what material we want to have ?
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">17:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> did we receive any feedback from ambassadors on the sort of material they'd like to have ?
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">17:04:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> yaloki, +1
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">17:05:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   your quesiton in regards to physical stuff  as in  "what more do we want?"
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">17:05:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I did not receive much i need to confess
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">17:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> or.. "what do we want", without the "more" :)
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">17:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> banners, t-shirts, gizmos, DVDs, stickers, flyers, folders, ...
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">17:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> if someone will not be responsible for push ambassadors to answer taht important question
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">17:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I can do that
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">17:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but most of that cannot be sent out to ambassadors without monies
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">17:05:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, go for it
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">17:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro, being shy won't help :)
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">17:06:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> yeah, ideally, that feedback should come from them
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">17:06:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   we have a tentative budget for banners.   We put it on hold until after the conference because gnokii wants further clarification on artwork before we spend on it
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">17:06:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> what are you need help with?
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">17:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> that would really help, they're out there in the field :)

<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">17:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> do we have a list of things we think are needed yet ?
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">17:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> izabelvalverde,   you brought up need for more reference to materials online.  Can you give examples where you'd like to see more of something?
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">17:07:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   that's what we're trying to determine now  :-)
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">17:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> okay, good :)
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">17:07:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> for me... flyers and folders are the best start
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">17:08:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> izabelvalverde,  we don't have enough or?

<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">17:08:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and folders?

<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">17:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and not cram everything into one

<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">17:09:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">simon123:</span> corporate identity, I guess :)

<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">17:09:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> stupid question, why does a open community needs a 'corporate' identity ?
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">17:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> ok, so we need to define artwork CI before being able to finalize flyers and such
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">17:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> isn't that more in the scope of Novell/SUSE Linux (and not openSUSE) ?
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">17:09:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> well, just a common style/palette/...

<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">17:14:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> amonthoth, it has unnecessary logos on parts that are never seen when assembled, this increases production custs without benefits... It could also be sized for A4 or A3 papers... so actually any people could print it out and make it. It's cheaper to get a toner for the printer than have to pay to the printing industry for professional printing...
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">17:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> amonthoth, that kinda stuff :)

<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">17:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and with that, I'd like to wrap up the meeting with a few words
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">17:18:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We spend a lot of time quibbling on specific tiny tiny details instead of focusing on the high level overviews of our team needs
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">17:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We need to start doing a better job of focusing because we end up more unclear and ambivalent than when we started the meetings
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">17:18:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;amonthoth&gt;</span> that is because i thought making artworks available at least to modify the text content
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">17:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> define "marketing tool"
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">17:19:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So please folks...  discussion about topics need to stay focused.  And when we get into nitty gritty stuff like printing, etc.  put them in discussions with those who can make it happen for the better.  Not for the whole team meeting.
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">17:19:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> gnokii, I think he meant 'marketing asset' ;)

<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">17:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> As i have been saying repeatedly, everyone in openSUSE is a member of the marketing team, they just don't know it yet.   And to that effect, if we aren't organized better, they can't participate easily
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">17:20:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, mind if I do a critic ?
