<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Just a short note:
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:01:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I'm going on parental leave from December 14th to February 13th.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">16:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> After changing diapers, renovating the house, celebrating x-mas, getting my son settled in the daycare
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">16:01:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> and some real vacation, I hope to be refreshed again and fully concentrate on openSUSE
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:02:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, right now I try to find some people that take over some of my responsibilities - inside and outside Novell.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I will take care that everything I do which is important will be handled during the time, e.g. even better reaction to PromoDVD shipping - and silently hope that after the parental leavelit works farbetter without me than right now ;)
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:03:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, you all have a short break from me...
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:03:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> :\
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:03:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I, for one,say that is a well deserved break for a hard worker like AJaeger    Well done on the past year,Herr AJaeger
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:03:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I don't know how much time I'll spend online but I will not be in the office.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:03:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> You're the first to hear this publically, I haven't blogged etc. about it yet...
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Can you be sure to post somewhere the appropriate avenues to contact for any resources we need in your absence?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well a son is always a priority...
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:04:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, keep this in mind when you see me asking for volunteers or I tell about changed contact addresses for some areas (or push generic ones).

<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   yes indeed,  that part is nothing to slow down on.   And we shold encourage everyone to apply now (if they are qualified) if they want to vote in upcoming elections
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, a question whatever the election commitee does will it be on mailing lists not just the results
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">16:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I was referring to the overall schedule
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   results of the final election  or the results of the decisions for deadlines etc?
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:18:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> does we have any kind of assistent or trainee position for commite, I mean, a good idea will be to pick some experienced guys and mix with young ones to prepare the new genereations for the next elections time
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">16:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Election rules and the committee
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">16:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> they *should* post it widely on project mailing list and everywhere else

<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">16:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I have aquestion about marketing materials
<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">16:43:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and so instead of talking about it, its time to actually plan to gather and make it a high-motion action
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">16:43:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,  yes?
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">16:44:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> instead of running u should learn to walk first
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">16:44:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I'm thinking about making a t-shirt about 11.4 release
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">16:44:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii, if you have an objection to these collaboration meetings, why didn't you object to it in the last meeting?
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">16:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> like consert t-shirt from bands,with dates and places of the release parties
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">16:44:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> which meeting?
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">16:45:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   I'd suggest you confab with the artwork team on that and express your ideas.  They may already be planning something, I don't know
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">16:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   the last marketing meeting I was at that you were also at in which we talked about spending a day or two like a hackfest to review our current matierals like slides etc and build new ones or improve the existing ones, etc.
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">16:46:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok but before moving that to the artwork team I'd like to see what do you think about it
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">16:46:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   I think if you have a great idea, you should definitely propose it.   Saying "I would like to do a tshirt" isn't going to get much.... "I would like to do a tshirt and here's what I think it should look like" will get better answers to your questions
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">16:47:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can it be I said there u have to do something first before u can talk about material can that be can it be that u that ignore?
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">16:47:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Can you just say what needs to be done first?
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">16:47:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> suseROCKs ok
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">16:48:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> think have only to say guideline
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">16:48:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> I still do not understand what you mean, please write in clear sentences instead of throwing random words in the channel.
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">16:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> can it be that I try since months that the marketing team begins to build an guide for the visual identity of openSUSE?
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">16:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii   I mean if you would like to propose a guidelines discussion to get it done with, let's do that.   Nothing preventing that.   I support that
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">16:50:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I will help too
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">16:50:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> gnokii, I don't see how that conflicts with what suseROCKs proposes
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">16:50:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> then do it and dont talk about material
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">16:50:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> this t-shirt also could be part of a ambassador kit I think
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">16:50:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> there is a big conflict talking about material before that is done is stupid
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">16:50:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro yes
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">16:50:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Let's get forward to the general concept of collaboration sessions - and handle the single topics in another step.
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">16:51:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes  thank you
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">16:51:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I mean : Let's get back on topic iwth the general concept
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">16:51:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> and everytime a ambassador receives a ambassador kit for a event they will also receive that special t-shirt
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">16:51:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so  in December, I'd like to see us all make meeting times outside of our normal marketing team meetings where we will sit down and collaborate on specific topics that we want to see moved forward
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">16:52:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro yes again,something like that
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">16:52:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> u pay for that, we make that
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">16:52:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> fopr example,  social media strategy,   marketing materials,   marketing guidelines, etc.
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">16:52:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  I hope our foundaton will pay for that :D
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">16:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Good idea. What about meeting time?
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:52:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> yeah after u made the sponsorship for that
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">16:52:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> this is important for us because people are asking for materials and not seeing anything.  We have a responsibility to the rest of the Project to have everything available for them properly
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">16:52:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> but I really agree with you +1
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">16:53:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,    Well I'm thinking we dedicate a specific day of the week each week.   Like maybe  Every monday is Collaboration Day?   What do you think?
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">16:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Would you guys like to have a dedicated collaoboration day each week?   One day when you know everyone's there focusing on a specific topic of the day?
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">16:54:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">16:54:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, Yes.. but suseROCKs this collaboration should mean shorter meetings
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">16:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> maybe we can do twice per mounth, instead of every week
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">16:54:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I believe it would be cool
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">16:54:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> A day is fine but we should find a way to record everything so that people can join for a copule of hours and don't need to participate the whole day from the start
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">16:55:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But then we prioritize it yes..
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">16:55:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> +1
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">16:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   Well  they're hackfests...   So  as is typical with online collaborations or hackfests,  people come and go throughout the day  and its easier for people globally to peek in at their hourly convenience.
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">16:55:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we could make 2-3 meeting around the day
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">16:55:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and find a way to put it together
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">16:56:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> On the one hand we can try and experiment to find what works - and on the other hand we can check what others do for those kind of days.
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">16:56:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, agreed but the hackfest would generally be done by us so we need to prioirtize it
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">16:56:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> also these hackfests should decrease our marketing jobs
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">16:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   SLOW DOWN
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">16:56:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> first is   "Do we want to do it that way?"
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">16:57:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then is... "Okay  what do we prioritize"
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">16:57:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> stop jumping ahead!
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">16:57:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I am sorry...
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">16:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  Let's try it for 3 times - and then ask again ;)
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">16:57:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So does everyone want a collaobration day and if so, what day of the week do we want to do this?
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">16:57:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is a weekend better for more participation than week?
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">16:57:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Iwant and I believe monday is fine
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">16:58:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Monday is fine with me too
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">16:58:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok anyone else?
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">16:58:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> monday sounds good
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">16:58:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I'm fine
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:58:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok fine...
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">16:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> now...  topics we should cover each week  are:

<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">17:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> anyway back to the topic as we are running out of time here
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">17:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Let's recap, you mentioned three topics:
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">17:05:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we have the following suggested topics  (priority not set yet) for
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">17:05:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Guidcelines
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">17:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Marketing Materials
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">17:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Guidelines for Marketing, Social Media and Marekting Materials.
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">17:05:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Social Media
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">17:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> what else?
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">17:05:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> is anything missing from that list?
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">17:06:04 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">and suseROCKs did not organize that one ;)</span>
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">17:06:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think those are the three priorities
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">17:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anout marketing materials I am a bit confused, I could plan a marketing material but what are the possibilities of see that happening?
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">17:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> about marketing materials I am a bit confused, I could plan a marketing material but what are the possibilities of see that happening?
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">17:06:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and my suggestion for first priority is the Guidelines  and second meeting will be materials and third will be social media
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">17:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> Jos has some money for marketing materials but no unlimited fund ;)
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">17:07:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">17:07:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> Let's discuss that on the meeting itself
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">17:07:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well  marketing materials is not limited to just physical stuff.  It also is including online stuff  electronically
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">17:07:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what meeting?
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">17:07:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> warlordfff, like presentations
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">17:07:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> The proposed meeting ;)
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">17:07:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> like  making sure we have good stock presentations,  review of our talking points, etc.
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">17:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I'm lost
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">17:07:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   so during the "Marketing Materials Meeting" we would discuss and hack out all the things we identify we are strong and weak on
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">17:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> when the "Marketing Materials Meeting" will happen,sorry I stucked a bit
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">17:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> warlordfff,   Ahh,  now I see where you got confused  :-)
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">17:09:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> after the guidelines are done before that it makes no sense
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">17:09:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we are having weekly collaboration meetings in December, as you agreed as well
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">17:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> one of those meetings will cover marketing materials

<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">17:32:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Where is the design for 11.4?

<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">17:33:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> gnokii, I expect that we do the 11.4 PromoDVD design in time this time with the artwork team
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">17:34:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I hope so, but I fear open-slx dont like the grey background
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">17:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> Why should we do a separate KDE CD?
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">17:34:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">17:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> openslx will take what the project does - but the design of the box is their call.
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">17:35:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> the KDE folks get always from us DVD at events
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">17:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> And the GNOME ones as well ;)

<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">17:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> It's far easier to have a single media than two or three - logistics are too complicated and the price benefit in producting will not help.
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">17:37:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> have nothing against to make extra gnome
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">17:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> thats what I feared
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">17:37:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> But still, I keep this as soemthing to discuss when we produce for 11.4 - we should evaluate the options.
