<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:37:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span>  I agree, but the better world will be if CD's DVD's was delivered by ambassadors,
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">15:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> because this we are pushing hard anyone that enjoys and work with openSUSE to be a ambassadors

<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:38:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;silviopalmieri&gt;</span> but rather to achieve something at this level in Brazil, I think we have to show professionalism in the first place, showing that we truly are, I think that first moment in our same sacrifice
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:38:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so let's not haggle this subject.   We don't have any right now, and will await Michl's announcement
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> silviopalmieri,   Okay. When the DVDs are ready, estimate how many you need and contact Michl for shipment.   But right now, we have nothing.  We ran out.
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:39:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">silviopalmieri:</span> could you translate to portugues michl announcement after michl done?

<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;silviopalmieri&gt;</span> dvd is more expensive not only seira best live cd and it works now that the fashion will follow what's right at least here in Brazil
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:41:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok we can talk about that more later.  We're not opposed what you say, silviopalmieri.  But right now, we have none to give.  When we have, we will give.

<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">16:02:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">michl:</span> he's saying that favorable attention to bloggers this time around might pay off for 11.4
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">16:02:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   What he's saying is that if we tweet the favorable ones and therefore drive more traffic to them, then in return they will talk more about us in next release
