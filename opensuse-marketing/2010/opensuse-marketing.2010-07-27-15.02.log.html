<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:10:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well SUSEStuddio is not an openSUSE project, although we do relate together.   They should communicate directly with us when they want our help promoting them.

<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:15:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> our mirror network was really great.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:15:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> The announcement was read 60k times (normal news.o.o 10k).
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:15:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> the rest on my blog post
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> how did the digg article fair?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:16:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> it went really good but we could have improved far better
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I would've thought on a tech site it would've gotten a lot of hits
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> digg was bad, I gave up checking - it depressed me
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> bah
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> slashdot?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Dominian:</span> no idea
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:17:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> With both of those sites, they are great media outlets, but unless you are 'well known' author nothing gets seen unfortunately
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> reddit was a wasteland too on launch day
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> I asked a few days ago yaloki to add an digg, twit this etc section on every article on the planet
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the linux subreddit is heavy with Arch and Ubuntu users though, not very kind :(
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> +1
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:17:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> good idea...
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> just to add a point of that the ati-rpm I've build have be downloaded 681 times for 64bits and 281 times for 32bits
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> if anybody has suggestion for iimproving news.o.o, please tell me as well!
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:18:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so we need to give our social networking efforts a boost for next time.  Sounds like we didn't do as well as 11.2 in that area.  But that's okay
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:18:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Definitely a boost - and don't allow wstephenson to become another kid ;)
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:18:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> AJ you said digg performance was suffering. Any clue why ? To help us to  fix in next time?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:18:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   We need more editorial review for news.o.o.  There was a title in there in last week's newsletter that nearly gave me a heart attack when I read it on my phone on the road  :-)
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:18:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I say it again not boosting that! thats not important
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:18:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Well, from what I can tell, there just wasn't as much emphasis on the tech sites for openSUSE as there was for 11.2
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:19:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> this launch wa sa great team effort - I learned a lot, not having a community manager gave us all a chance to step up.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Why is it not important to spread the word?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> please don't forget two important things : end of world cup soccer, and July is allmost hollidays :-)
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:19:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Exactly.   In many ways, even with dismal numbers, we improved as a team.  And that rocked!
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:19:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> IMHO, watching the social sites move and shift during the release, titles with version numbers didn't help so much, but titles with "New X in openSUSE 11.3" do well
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:19:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> no idea
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:20:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> not to spread the word, its not the right way to think twitter and such things are the most important thing, btw. I never saw ubuntu on top hashs in releas time
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> rtyler,   Good point.  Sexier titling would help.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:20:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> Digg/Reddit are **ALL** about headlines
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:20:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> "openSUSE 11.3 released" was a weak headline
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> "BP CEO PUNTS A BABY AND INSTALLS OPENSUSE" would have done great though ;)
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:21:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> yep, focus on what's cool and interesting works better.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> LOL

<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">15:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> anyway to have a IRC channel for Ambassadors in Brazil?
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">15:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I need it
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">15:42:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> Just create one adhoc
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:42:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> where is there a problem so make one
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:42:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   why not use opensuse-pt?
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">15:42:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> /join opensuse-ambassadors-pt
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:42:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> no problem using pt, but I believe a special irc for ambassador will be much better
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:43:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   You can create IRC channel in instant just by typing /join #(channel name)   or if you want to create a formal permanent one, talk to Darix so we can keep it under openSUSE management
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:43:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> how many Ambassadors are there actually?
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But you cannot find people all the time on the ambassador list
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> opensuse-pt, have all related stafs for portugues, not for ambassador, and this is a huge gap
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">15:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> not bad idea at all. I would indeed create the channel, see if ppl want to get involved. Spread the word, if we can help, let us know...
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">15:44:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> suseROCKs and gnokii gave you the recipe

<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">15:44:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">15:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> may i raise one question
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">15:44:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">15:45:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> (regarding the irc thing)
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">15:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> btw I created long time ago a chan opensuse-ambassadors but it was never used
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">15:45:04 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">has just been promoted to chef for the day</span>
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">15:45:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> darix,  maybe.  :-)
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">15:45:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">darix:</span> Go ahead, Sir!
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">15:46:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> well rather 2 notes: 1. this channel is rather idle. so instead of splitting out an ambassador channel now, use this channel. and if you do an ambassador channel (or uses gnokii's) keep one ofr all langages
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">15:46:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> for all languages
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">15:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> i mean you share most problems i guess
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">15:46:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> and if 2-3 ambassadors talk about a specific thing for their country it wouldnt be so much noise
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">15:46:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> darix +1 because of that I asked CarlosRibeiro how many Ambassadors are there in Brazil
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">15:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> too many channels are bad
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">15:47:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> yeah having a separate channel is bad
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">15:47:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> we could also use the marketing channel for now, it's often very silent
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">15:47:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> there's enough channels already!
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">15:47:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> :
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">15:47:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> )
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">15:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> i have no problem with regging more channels. but having channels with just 1-2 persons in it is waste
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">15:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> that's why I suggested to use opensuse-pt (or whatever the pt languge channel is)  that way even non  Ambassadors can hear and learn about what's going on
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">15:47:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> +1 on that
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">15:47:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> thats all from my side
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">15:47:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok here's what I'd like to do...
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">15:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  I believe we have between 10 to 15 ambassadors here, be we are grwowing very very fast
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">15:47:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yep, depends of course on the amount of noise. But if there is too much, creating a new channel for a quick chat is darn easy anyway...
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">15:48:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we have 26 states, and I'm looking fot at least 2 ambassadors for state
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">15:48:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> There's a lot we can do and need to do to formalize and clear up the ambassador program and that could take up to an hour of discussion.
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">15:48:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And not everyone here is interested in ambassadorship
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">15:48:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;darix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> i see only 26 people here. so you need to get them here asap :p
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">15:48:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> u believe? I never saw 10 or 15 Brazilians on the Ambassador list
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">15:49:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So how about we set up an ambassador meeting soon  9perhaps next week) and gather up as many participants as we can and just have an open meeting about what people like/dislike about the program
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">15:49:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> bad idea
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">15:49:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   To give CarlosRibeiro fair credit, he has been doing a lot of work lately organizing and working with ambassdors and potential ambassadors in Brazil.  Doing some great stuff too.  I don't want to make the bar too  high for him.
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">15:50:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> http://wiki.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Ambassadors_list
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">15:50:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   ok what do you propose then?
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">15:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> yep, 11 from Brazil, you Brazilians rock!
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">15:51:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh, I don't think people realize how large brazil is sometimes.. :)
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">15:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> Sao Paulo alone is enormous!
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">15:51:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> the problem is to discuss that always does not improve the program, we made some improvements last time that should make efforts in future, thats enough right now
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">15:52:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> wrong only that with user pages count!
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">15:52:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> we need first the ambassadors talking and exchanging stuff - so far they are lone islands
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">15:52:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span>  because this I'm spending more than 60% of my time here ;-)
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">15:53:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> I think you're too harsh
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">15:53:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> brazil and South america are huge potencials for the project but no one knows
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">15:53:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> well and it shows
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">15:53:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so quick vote.  Do we need to focus some time on Ambassador program organization  or let it stand as it is?
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">15:53:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> fully agreed.
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">15:53:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I disagree with the vote in itself
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">15:53:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I think the question should be:
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">15:53:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> no I dont because how shall we communicate with them, without a mail address?
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">15:53:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> who wants to put in time? if nobody, then it's moot anyway
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">15:53:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> One thing the ambassador program 'lacks' that I'd like to see, which only comes with official openSUSE membership, is an @opensuse.org email account.
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">15:54:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   well I would assume the "want to put in time" would vote +1  :-)

<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">15:59:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I like to do that, but I never did, I need a guide, or at least to learn how to do that, to be more prepared for the next ones

<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">16:03:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok let's try to move quickly on this one...
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">16:03:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> first of all  is Helping Hands revival.  We can probably talk more about this another time.   But I wanted to mention couple of things....
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">16:03:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 1)  manugupt1 has expressed interest in helping to revive it
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">16:03:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">16:03:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I am all for it
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">16:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Helping Hands?
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">16:03:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Can you give an a quick overview of what that is?
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">16:04:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> 2) I met with Fedora Team marketing in Portland last week and they are interested in joint-work together on Helping Hands
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">16:04:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,  A couple of years ago I set up Helping Hands here in openSUSE to educate users about different things in the distro.   Weekly one hour seminars.  It was good but very time consuming and exhausting to round up presenters
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">16:04:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> ahhh
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">16:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Hrm
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">16:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It needs to be revived in some form or another, and revised somehow to make it more effective.  We did have good turnouts
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">16:05:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Well, dedicated site with tutorials or something?
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">16:05:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Don't make them weekly at the beginning.  Better let's start e.g. every first Monday a month - and once we have routine, increase frequency....
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">16:05:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I mean I keep people saying something about screencasts or podcasts  etc etc
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">16:05:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Who knows, Dominian    That's something for a new team to figure out  :-)
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">16:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> ++
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">16:05:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> hehe
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">16:06:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but the nice thing here is that going forward, it won't be a one man operation (me)  it'll be multiple people and even multiple distros
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">16:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Sounds great!
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">16:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And hopefully Helping Hands will go even farther.   I had even talked about it with GNOME Marketing months ago.  So we could really grow and openSUSE would be honored for creating this groundswell
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">16:06:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so keep that idea/project in mind folks....
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">16:07:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Next on the list....
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">16:07:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> openSUSE Shop.   We don't give this much attention.   Do we want to give this love?
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">16:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Who manages the shop now?
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">16:07:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> good point suseROCKs
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">16:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> Yes !
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">16:08:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Michl on his full plate
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">16:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  I would like to start a openSUSE shop at south america
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">16:08:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Yes we need to give the shop some love
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">16:08:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we have only in ASIA, Europe, and EUA
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">16:09:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I was just looking at the shop.. and I see no polo shirts
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">16:09:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I need polo shirts for work people! :)
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">16:09:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> are we talking about online shop or the physical shop ?
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">16:09:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> online shop iirc
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">16:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> Dominian, +1 :-)
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> okay !
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So how about does someone here want to be co-maintainer of the shop with michl?  Responsible for marketing efforts coordinated globally?
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">16:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> SJ,   Uhh  what physical shop?
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">16:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Well, is there anyway to get more 'product' on the shop?
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:09:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  globally includes Brazil ?
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:09:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> From what I see there's a lack of product.. not enough variety
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:10:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> suseROCKs, CarlosRibeiro was interest in South America , so I thought something personal in the cities over there :)
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">16:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   yes.  Globally meaning, looking at viability of new markets that we don't cater to right now
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ;-)
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this reminds me, I need a hoodie :D
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:10:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> u are sure thats the right time to improve the shop? Should the board not found a foundation before we beginning to earn more money?
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> suseROCKs, what are the exact task of the co-maintainer ?
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:10:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> task(s) *
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   the shop's primary function is to market by spreading the word openSUSE through products.   While it would be nice to have the Foundation assume revenue control for the shop, there's no reason why we should sit and wait for Foundation 9which will take time)
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:12:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> while there are people now interested in developing their markets, like CarlosRibeiro
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">SJ:</span> Tasks to be defined - basically taking ownership and maintaining it

<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:12:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I dont  see that, I would buy a shirt for 20€
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:12:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> SJ,   it needs to be someone experienced in looking at online vendors that sell the Shop for us.  and someone who can be creative in what products we can offer in which regions.
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:12:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> +nt

<a name="l-652"></a><span class="tm">16:42:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> But we could continue doing obs marketing, there are some interviews that saigkill_ did and those could be made into nice stories about how people use obs
<a name="l-653"></a><span class="tm">16:42:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I think that's all now.
<a name="l-654"></a><span class="tm">16:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> can I say something?

I prefer we take it slowly and do it right this time.
<a name="l-664"></a><span class="tm">16:43:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> will most discussions about helping hands occur on -marketing or -project? I'd like to publicize them on omgsuse a good amount
