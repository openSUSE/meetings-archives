<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:07:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Have you pinged SUSEStudio yet?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:08:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Yes, first chat this morning, more to come
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:08:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:08:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   Have you thought of a marketing topic (or request a slot to be reserved) for the openSUSE Conference?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> Btw. should we mark those directly that are done in the wiki once they are done?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I have not yet come up with something
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:09:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> spend some time brainstorming but no result
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> yet
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:09:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   yes, I will be doing that, but folks should mark it as done on their own if they can
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:09:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   Ok,  at least notify the planning committee that you want a slot.   We can always figure out something as time comes by
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:10:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> done
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger has created the ambassador mailing list, and I'm very appreciative of the amount of traffic we have there so far.   Very good
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:11:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJ and I have created the open jobs page, its a continual WIP,   but here it is:  http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_jobs
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:11:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> very bad! Its my opinion and this time u have to accept my opinion on that topic
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Please review and add jobs if you think there's anything relevant, or volunteer to take on a job.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:11:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   which topic is that?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> the topic mailinglist
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> okay, state your opinion
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:13:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> traffic isnt a yardstick
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> especially when traffic is from marketing list
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well it is a new list,  give it time
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  +1
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I think people need time to understand and separate what belongs in marketing and what belongs in ambassadors.   There's some overlap, for sure, but in time people will be able to make a better distinction
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:15:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> no, not give time!
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:15:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Then what do you propose?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:15:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I recognized in ur schedule there is a talk about last "ambassador" meeting
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I make a point there
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:16:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> then we'll return to this topic at that point
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> going further down the list....
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> My action item for "Beginner Liaison" information.  We have a page, but we need to fix the URL currently.  Wiki team with Dominian is working on it.

<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:21:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So please, folks.  There's lots of creative ways to be a liaison, so your feedback on this page is greatly appreciated
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Moving along the list of AI's,  AJ and me to keep up with OBS for next press release.  AJ,  any date on OBS 2.1 release yet?
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:21:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'm working on saving up some money so I can get a shirt and messenger bag.. but might be a while.. that should help with some of th emarketing and being a liasion as I'll have the 'gear' on me :)
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:21:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Not yet
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:22:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I do have feedback on that page, should I make edits or mail it? (sorry for late response)
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> Which page?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:22:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_liaison
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:22:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   use the discussion link.  i think that's best
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:23:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   but if you have stuff to add, just go ahead and add.   You know, use your judgement whether something is add-able or discuss-able  :-)
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I would suggest to make minor edit directly, otherwise discuss on the opensuse-marketing mailing list.
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Ok I think we have covered most of the AI's.  There's a couple that are Ambassador related, and we'll save that for the Ambassador topic
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:23:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Okay
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:24:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> for what is that marketing liason whats that for bullshit
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:25:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> I don't like the term much either but the concept is simple: someone who helps in marketing a certain sub project
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:25:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   as we have been discussing for many months now, we encourage individuals to seek out teams in openSUSE to be more aware of any promotional  opportunities
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:25:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> and at last meeting, we decided to create some liaison page to give guidance to those who are interested in that.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:25:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> there are some doubled tasks fro "marketing liason" and "ambassadors"
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:25:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> eg the openSUSE apache team might need a bit more visibility. You might be interested in helping out, so you can eg write about them in a blog, in articles, on the website, etcetera
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:26:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no  there's a difference between liaison and ambassadors
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:26:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ambassadors so something for all of opensuse in a specific region
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:26:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ambassadors work outside, whereas  liaison keeps tabs on things happening internally
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> liasons do something for a small part of openSUSE for the whole world
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:26:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it's like the other way around
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> as suseROCKs said...
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:26:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it helps people to become "subject matter experts" in their chosen area
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:26:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> this is just what I gather from seeing the page 5 seconds, of course, the plan might have been different
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">15:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we had something like that in KDE but never formalized like this...
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">15:27:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you got it right, jospoortvliet

<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">15:27:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Do we have already any liaisons?  I would list them on the page
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">15:28:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   right now, you and I are OBS liaisons, and rtyler is Smeegol liaison.   I'm hoping to see others become KDE or GNOME liaisons, and build further from there.
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">15:28:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I never discussed "liason" its like always its dictade from suseROCKs
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">15:28:29 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">will update the pages now...</span>
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">15:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I must say you guys spend a lot of time on planning and creating these pages and stuff. In basis, that's OK, but you do also need ppl to do it. I would suggest for something like this to keep the page short and let ppl sort it out - once we have some 'liasons' they can organize themselves. Just a general opinion, not saying it's bad to plan...
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">15:29:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   We do have some liaisons.  See above  :-)
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">15:29:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ok. So they should be in charge of the page for sure :D
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">15:29:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">15:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> but you must agree it is not a bad idea, wheter it was discussed or not. If it wasn't that sucks a bit, but if there are ppl doing it it is fine to formalize it a bit
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">15:30:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> no I dont agree
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">15:30:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it's been discussed many times that we have some sort of embedded relationship with various teams.   It was only in the last meeting that we came up with the term "liaison" but it wasn't a formally decided name, just a quick name to define the task
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">15:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> u like to kidding me I always locked in here nver saw a discussion
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">15:31:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> ok but you can't see every discussion, neither can I...
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">15:31:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I can
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">15:31:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> so you don't like the name or don't you like the concept itself?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">15:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> hehe ok if you read every discussion I suggest to drink more beer and get a girlfriend (or boyfriend, whatever tickles you) ;-)
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">15:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> or gnokii  dislike both name and concept?
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">15:32:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> that have nothing to do with name or the concept its more how its done especially after suseROCKs called me last meeting a "dictator"
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">15:32:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> aaah ok
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">15:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> that makes sense, and it's understandable if you feel like it's being cooked up by one person
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:33:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> however - imho that process fits in very much with FOSS: who codes, decides. Then once it is presented, others can comment, suggest, change
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> its a little bit ugly, to bring up such things hidden after a schedule
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:33:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> aha jospoortvliet I code a little bit more so I make some decissions!
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:34:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> please, it's not personal, did you forgot the lines "have a lot fun" ? the only think suseROCKs  are doing is trying to help us to take our marketing level to the next step
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:34:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> well suseROCKs brought it up now, maybe a bit late, but are you OK with the concept itself?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> the marketing team gets not forward on this way and thats the problem
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> no
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> CarlosRibeiro I think this doc is a step forward, why would it not be?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:35:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I am not ok with this, he can schedule it next meeting
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:35:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> seriously dude, why would this be delayed?
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:36:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so every from us here can think about it, and then
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:36:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> so isn't that exaclty what suseROCKs proposed? "here it is, look at it, comment"
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:36:56 </span><span class="nka">* gnokii</span> <span class="ac">not who codes decides, in a team should every opinion heard and thats how a floss community works</span>

<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> the problem is it was hidden behind a schedule!

<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it's good to do things that way, how else?
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:38:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> I looked yesterday after the schedule and I subscribed the rss of wiki never saw the canges!

<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:38:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so you have a problem with late schedule change
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:39:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> well that's a valid point, let me say sorry for suseROCKs for that, I'm sure he didn't want to push this through throats this way...

<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">15:42:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Carlos, can you give us a quick recap on last week's meeting and what's next?
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:42:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:42:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> that would be a funny point too
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">15:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> last meeting we had good audience
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">15:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> about our next steps, we had a voting
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">15:43:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so now I have a question
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">15:43:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> one good think that happed was a good interaction with ambassadors for all continents
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">15:43:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> the question goes directly to AJaeger and suseROCKs
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">15:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">15:44:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> that show us that Ambassadors program must be keep going as a Team, because most dificulties that I have here, HeliosReds showed that also have in Japan
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">15:45:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> u talking about  next steps and mean such things like "uniform" with this?
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">15:45:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  that FIRST one was just a brainstorm
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">15:45:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> maybe at this point there is a little conflict
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">15:46:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> if you follow our Ambassadors ML, you will see that some "next steps" like Uniforms, is not our priority right now
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">15:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> when u make a "brainstorm" u should first recognize the status of a thing
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">15:46:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> `while I'm still here,sorry but gnokii I think you should let CarlosRibeiro finish his talk first this makes things impossible to follow
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">15:47:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> first we had a brainstorm, that still running on ML
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">15:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> u said who codes decides and for this point I like to know if was my code so buggy that its taken from me
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">15:47:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> thanks... I will continue about "recap ambassadors meeting"
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">15:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Nothing was taken from you.  A meeting of the ambassadors was called simply because we wanted to hear what Ambassadors had to say.
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">15:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we still consider you a part of the Ambassador program, and CarlosRibeiro's only role was to drive the meeting (and results from that meeting)   he is not taking over the Ambassador program.   Nor have we declared it was taken from you.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">15:49:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we had some good feedback from most part of ambassadors
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">15:49:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> besides, why would anyone want to take anything from anyone else if there is so much work to do...
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">15:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> yeah at that is the first problem u drived a meeting
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">15:49:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I mean seriously, if you are unhappy with someone doing part of your work - lemme know and I give you 10 other things to do :D
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:49:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> u had 10 votes from 179 ppl und u say thats good?
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">15:49:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> it gives some idea
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">15:49:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> anyway good luck all be nice to each other I have to leave will read the full log later on
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:50:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  the importance now is not only NUMBERS but QUALITY too
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> u are kidding me
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:50:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> quality means a few ppl decides for the masses?
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:50:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  if no one have questions any question about last ambassador meeting, I suggest you to move on
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">15:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we need to be productive and keep our focus
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">15:51:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> Nothing was taken from you.  A meeting of the ambassadors was called simply because we wanted to hear what Ambassadors had to say.
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">15:52:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> aha so I have to see now votings for uniforms
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">15:52:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   I don't recall anything being decisive.   This was simply an opportunity to give ambassadors a chance to speak up, and they did.
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">15:52:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> u should better say "some" ambassadors
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">15:52:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   As I responded to that email, and even discussed with CarlosRibeiro on the side,  uniforms and some other stuff cannot be decided upon at this time.  It's premature.  I agree with you
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">15:53:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  by the way, our VOTES, was only because U asked for, and for my surprise I dind't see your votes
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">15:53:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so my next steps on ambassador program are others
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">15:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I asked for votes? Show me where I did that
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">15:53:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   great!   So any suggestions how we reach out to those who did not come to the meeting or have not responded to the ML yet?
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">15:53:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> just to finsih and to make thinks clear, our ambassadors meetings was for give opportunity to listen other ambassadors needs and dificulties
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:54:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> not to decide anything
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:54:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I am surly not asked for such stupid votes like "should we develop a ambassador landing page"
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:54:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> because the page exists
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we even don't know what is need it, how will we decide something?!?!
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Please tone down your language.  You can get your point across a lot faster if you don't ridicule others.
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:54:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> when u not know whats needed why u not aks for it?
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:55:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> u called me last time an dictator never heard an excuse for it
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:55:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> That's what we're doing right now, the discussions are going on.

<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:59:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> That's a good question.. probably best to bring it up with #opensuse-wiki and get everyone's thoughts on it
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:59:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> My guess, it would be good to at least link to it on the distribution portal.

<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:59:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> as it does apply to everything as a whole and not just marketing etc
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:59:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Dominion sure...
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:59:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But we have to review all our old pages on the old wiki and make sure the new wiki is easily naviagable
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:59:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ahhh yes.. I was just about to bring thta up hehe
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">16:00:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,   bring it up as in "I'd like to drive this one"?   :-D
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">16:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> If you guys are watching the mailing list Rajko brings up a good point in following wiki standardizsation.
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">16:00:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> ha.. I wish.. I'm so busy at work it would be pointless to put me in charge of anything right now
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">16:00:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Fair enough
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">16:00:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I would love to be able to lend more of a hand.. with school here starting.. business here at work has quadrupled.
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:01:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> and I'm floored with work right now
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">16:01:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> however, I have been going over the wiki and will be attempting to keep reviewing pages etc.
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">16:01:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> we are here in a wiki meeting
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">16:02:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> okay so anyone want to join with Dominian?  I'll also be joining in as I have been looking at stuff in the last week too.    More hands are better and we need to get this done quickly
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">16:02:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I need to confess that I fells like a blind guy on war, when I step in wiki pages
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">16:02:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We have too many "where is that?" questions popping up lately
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">16:02:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I added navigation links to your freshly created pages to make them easier to find ;)
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">16:02:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> One thing..
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">16:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Hmm  I need to learn about that.   I guess just adding category doesn't suffice?
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">16:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> If people are finding it hard to find things... the list should probably be updated with those..
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">16:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I added the marketing_navbar (see first line of page) - and added links to it.  Category:Marketing is needed as well.
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">16:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Dominian, If you can help me a little I can transfer pages until a week before my exams
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">16:04:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I will assist as I can :)
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">16:04:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> I'm still getting used to it all myself to be honest :)
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">16:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so how best to proceed?   Should we just email each other or?
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">16:04:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> So there are times I will screw something up and have to edit and undo things before I get it right
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">16:05:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Would using the mailing list be appropriate or ?
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">16:05:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,   I have never seen you screw up anything  :-)

<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">16:05:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,   Well that's the question.   Do we want to spam the marketing list with lots of little tidbits  or do we want to just have a small email subgroup amongst those actually working on it?  And then give formal information via ML?
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">16:06:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> hrm

<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:07:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> How are translations currently handled on the wiki?  Does a translation team broadly handle all translations for the wiki?  or is it on a per-team basis?

<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:08:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> The big thing is some of the 'older' stuff
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Does it need to be kept?  If so, archive it?  How?
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Like the YaST contest, meeting archives and all
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> moving is one thing.   organizing or re-organizing them in a sane manner is the other thing  :-)

<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">16:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> The big thing I found is that some of th eexternal links are broken or moved

<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">16:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> So sometimes you have to hunt for the new link
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">16:09:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I will take care of that moving and organizing..
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">16:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> No idea.. not my call.. I'm just a 'helper' with the wiki.. I think it would be a good consensus with the marketing team to decide what they want done with older data.
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">16:10:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> So, we have Dominian and manugupt1 signing up for the job?  Good, I add to the Jobs page.
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">16:10:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Frankly, if its out of date and of no historical value.. drop it
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">16:10:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok  let's just set aside and initially do an ML discussion on this topic.   No need to bog down the meeting with the details like this

<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">16:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sorry for bad connection...
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">16:21:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span>  are you using 3G in Brazil?
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">16:21:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">16:22:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> anyone wants to go to meego conference in Dublin?
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">16:22:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I did some research with Helping Hands a few weeks back and spoke to Rupert about it
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">16:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ok.. I took 2 distros into consideration, one is UBUNTU and the other one is Fedora
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">16:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I found a huge amount of differences..
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">16:23:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Fedora is struggling as we are
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">16:23:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   I'll bet rtyler would love to go,  but he's waaaaay out in California  :-)
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">16:23:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Reason being not enough contributors
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">16:23:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Ubuntu on the other hand is lot more organised
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">16:24:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> u finance the trip?
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">16:24:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> They have irc classrooms and people are willing to spend time on it..
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">16:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Their schedules are well maintained and they do a lot of healthy work
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">16:24:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   yes that was the challenge we had here at Helping Hands in openSUSE
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">16:25:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> dear manugupt1 that we had last year and after it we decided to make it not in short time again, because it waisted our time
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">16:25:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, gnokii agreed completely
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">16:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> GNOME Foundation has also expressed an interest in some sort of helping hands project.   We should definitely set up some sort of consortium to pool all our resources together
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">16:25:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> I have an idea regarding this...
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">16:26:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Why not take students itself who are looking for projects because in this way they learn and also provide a certificate of appreciaiton
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">16:26:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Yes.. But we need to make sure there is someone who can chuck off the garbage..
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">16:26:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  the time chances the world too, maybe today is a better way to return to that point. Don't you think? Let manugupt1 conclude his points
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">16:27:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> dear CarlosRibeiro sure the world changes, but u not see when they change
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">16:27:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> Change is never ending; being prepared for that change is the task at hand.
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">16:28:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Let me continue with ubuntu again... they have weekly sessions which are well prepared in advance
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">16:28:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Dominian,   Very astute observation
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">16:28:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> are you referring to jono @ home?
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">16:28:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I'm a philosopher by night!
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">16:28:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> I really like the idea, at least as basis for us
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">16:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> like 'class room' stuff?
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">16:28:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> Dominian, yes.. irc classrooms
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">16:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> rtyler, I did not get you
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">16:29:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok i give up bad connecdtion cu later...
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">16:29:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Dominian&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> ok
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">16:29:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> go at suse office take ur beer with u
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">16:29:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> What I think is openSUSE 11.4 is scheduled for March if I am correct
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">16:29:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> don't worry jospoortvliet
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">16:29:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/08/04/at-home-with-jono-bacon-2/
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">16:30:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> So we can have an openweek at that time, also a hackweek
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">16:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> we have a hackweek ^^
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">16:30:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> it's kind of a cross between a helping-hands and community news/etc
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">16:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,    Let me give you little HH background
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">16:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> That would give plenty of time to plan, prepare and yes also a marketing boost
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">16:30:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> Yes, March. My proposal would be to have HH every month.
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">16:31:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, sure...
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">16:31:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> I envision HH also to help educate contributors on how to contribute to the openSUSE project, correct?
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">16:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> And in that case, HH will help us for 11.4.
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">16:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> HH was set up by the openSUSE-GNOME team for the purpose of helping new users to understand all the great features of openSUSE.    We had great turnouts during those initial months (11.1)   But our challenge was finding people to come by for giving presentations.
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">16:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span>  I agree with you, but if we never starts something like that, we will never finish
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">16:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we had a dream of expanding in that way to include more contributor-related presentations.   But my biggest mistake was that we had weekly sessions and that was too much with too little resources
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">16:32:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> AJaeger, suseROCKs Thats why I propose not a monthly session or a weekly one but a quarterly or half yearly or with every release
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">16:32:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> the problem is and u should learn that, starting such things means we havent enough power for this things they are more important
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">16:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   sure  But if you have too few, then people won't remember to come around.   It's a balance we have to figure out
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">16:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> + all of us would get bored teaching the same thing a hundred times..
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">16:33:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> its a old wishdom less is more then more
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">16:33:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, Well Lets give a call for volunteers and propose this thing
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">16:33:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   But that's why I like the new opportunity we have to restart it because Fedora and GNOME Fdn both are interested and want to work together.    We can make this a great consortium with less manpower drain on any of us
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">16:33:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span>  depends of who is presenting. Old messages never gets old for the new ones
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">16:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> If we make sessions on how others can contribute to openSUSE, then I would consider them very important.
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">16:34:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, +1 but someone has to take a lead
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">16:34:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> +1000000000
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">16:34:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">manugupt1:</span> Let's also call for good topics
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">16:34:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> +1 AJaeger    We do have a huge contributor gap wehre people want to contribute but don't know how
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">16:34:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> cool more becoming ppl they not want to go out of her office chair
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">16:35:03 </span><span class="nka">* AJaeger</span> <span class="ac">needs to leave now, be back later</span>
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">16:35:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> manugupt1,   Ok so let's sechedule some time together this week and we'll talk about it in more detail   okay?
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">16:35:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> AJaeger, I agree.. but I will like to have you guys have a look at ubuntu hackweek
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">16:35:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AJaeger:</span> -1000000000000000000000000000
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">16:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> IMO the "class"/"seminar" approach makes it difficult for folks to jump in
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">16:35:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> to contribute rather
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">16:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> rtyler,   well format is something that also needs to be addressed sure.
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">16:36:25 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">16:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> suseROCKs, +1
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">16:36:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so anything else?  otherwise this meeting is about to end
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">16:36:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> if you're expected to be an expert for 30 minutes, that's quite hard for most folks to want to sign up for ;)
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">16:37:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  I never saw something related with Universities here
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">16:37:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   like what?
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">16:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> this is not part of our Marketing program
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">16:37:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> rtyler, you cannot expect that but atleast give an idea honestly speaking 5% would carry on further and 1% would contribute but 1% should be good enough...
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">16:38:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> any depper involvemtn with universities, schools.....
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">16:38:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   If you're referring to teaching about open source in universities,  that's a different area.  I suggest you look at teachingopensource.org.   I work closely with them to get interns for GNOME-A11y marketing.   Its a good approach
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">16:38:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  I'm not talking about that
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">16:38:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> but it requires a lot more resources than helping hands which is more "seminar"-ish.
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">16:39:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> I'm talking about have a kind of partnership with some key universities
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">16:39:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> to guide them to better understand openSUSE ecosystem
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">16:40:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok well.. come up with a plan of what you have in mind, and then propose it.  :-)
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">16:40:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> speaking in very general terms doesn't move us forward.  :-)
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">16:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  ok, I will send a message to the ML

<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">16:40:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> I have sometimes the feeling u should better understand itself
