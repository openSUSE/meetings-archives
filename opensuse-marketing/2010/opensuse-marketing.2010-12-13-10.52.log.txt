10:52:57 <suseROCKs> #topic openSUSE Marketing Team | Marketing Review Collaboration Day http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing
10:53:29 <suseROCKs> And now we are on our way...  Good morning folks and welcome to our second iteration of December's Collaboration Days for the Marketing team
10:54:13 <suseROCKs> At http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing we have a list of assignments.  Many of the materials listed here already exist in some form and we just need to review and make sure they are proper and up to date
10:54:29 <suseROCKs> some items do not exist yet and we should review their need and implement them
10:54:50 <suseROCKs> And also, if there are additional items we think we need, we should add them as well.
10:55:10 <suseROCKs> and good morning AJaeger!
10:55:26 <AJaeger> Good morning, everybody!
10:56:10 <suseROCKs> Does anyone have any questions before we roll up our sleeves?
11:00:27 <jospoortvliet> let's just get crackin'
11:01:11 * gnokii takes jospoortvliet hand and crack it
11:01:12 <jospoortvliet> AJaeger: did you already manage to make the changes I send to that OBS 2 slide presentation>
11:01:22 <jospoortvliet> today I hope to create a 2-slide BS presentation
11:01:24 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: Not yet - will do later
11:01:27 <jospoortvliet> helen_au: input is welcome :D
11:01:35 <AJaeger> jospoortvliet: BS or Studio?
11:01:38 <jospoortvliet> bs should be SUSE Studio
11:01:40 <jospoortvliet> hehe
11:01:41 <jospoortvliet> sorry
11:01:43 <jospoortvliet> my mistake...
11:02:07 <jospoortvliet> I will also update my kitty presentation with those OBS and Studio slides...
11:02:23 <helen_au> :D
11:02:24 <jospoortvliet> not sure if anyone would want to use my kitty presentation but it has all the notes to use it and it's Free :D
11:02:40 <jospoortvliet> maybe some day I will try to make more 'normal' slides hehe
11:02:54 <suseROCKs> jospoortvliet,  are you referring to short decks that people can use to combine into their own presentations?
11:03:03 <jospoortvliet> suseROCKs: yes
11:03:16 <suseROCKs> good idea.
11:03:51 <helen_au> that's a great idea
11:03:59 <helen_au> finding stuff for presentations is a constant chore
11:04:07 <helen_au> images/slides...
11:04:25 <gnokii> helen_au: not really ;)
11:04:35 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   Its a bit of a delicate balance.  We can certainly store up as many different types of presentations, but keeping them up-to-date is harder
11:05:02 <helen_au> what I mean is, any time I've had to do one on other topics, it takes a lot of work
11:05:10 <helen_au> so providing resources is very helpful
11:05:26 <helen_au> especially ones you can easily adapt to suit your needs
11:05:47 <helen_au> (eg, a slightly different topic, different audience)
11:05:53 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   research takes time no matter what.   What do you suggest for creating easier paths of research?
11:06:23 <helen_au> perhaps a master list of slide-quality images grouped by topic
11:06:59 <helen_au> generic suse/ suse software/ people/ computer pictures / icons and illsutrations / colored backgrounds
11:07:03 <suseROCKs> wouldn't looking at the full-set slides be the way to just simply grab and pick from?
11:07:29 <helen_au> it depends on how big the sets are
11:07:52 <helen_au> but having complete sets ready to go is obviously a great idea too
11:08:04 <suseROCKs> we do have sets ready to go
11:08:36 <helen_au> how have people who've been doing SUSE presentations found our existing materials?
11:08:46 <helen_au> adequate or have you needed to search for additional images?
11:09:11 <gnokii> helen_au: I offered long time ago, to make background that can be used and if special pictures are needed to make them, but right now the wiki begins to turn in a jungle everyone means to upload his stuff again
11:09:12 <suseROCKs> http://en.opensuse.org/Presentations
11:09:41 <helen_au> (I know the wiki team do a great job, but I do find it a trifle challenging at times)
11:10:01 <suseROCKs> maybe slightly more than trifle  :-)
11:10:17 <helen_au> not sure if that's just me though :)
11:10:27 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   Perhaps that's the assignment you'd like to take on for today.  Looking at how we can "de-jungleify" the marketing wiki pages
11:10:35 <helen_au> um....
11:10:46 <helen_au> might be getting outside my expertise :)
11:10:59 <suseROCKs> that makes you perfect for it.
11:11:02 <helen_au> honestly, I find it SUCH a maze... and wikis seem to have particular rules
11:11:07 <helen_au> like they don't like redirects
11:11:08 <henne> first of all you could follow the wiki rules :)
11:11:13 <henne> that would greatly help
11:11:23 <gnokii> henne: +1
11:11:42 <henne> this is the second link i see in 5 minutes that completely ignores them ;)
11:12:02 <helen_au> I emailed a little while ago asking if anyone had done a user 'road test' of our materials
11:12:21 <helen_au> it's a method we sometimes use in our day job, getting friends or family to look for something on our website
11:12:38 <helen_au> and seeing how easy (or not) they find it to navigate
11:12:42 <suseROCKs> henne, can you explain more?   If we need to reorganize our pages more, then that's on the board for today  :-)
11:14:24 <henne> suseROCKs: what more should I explain?
11:14:32 <suseROCKs> For one thing, I can see its categorized under "Presentations" and "Marketing Presentations"
11:14:41 <gnokii> henne:  means follow the name conventions!
11:14:56 <suseROCKs> henne,  just point out precisely what it is that is going wrong.
11:15:01 <henne> okay
11:15:46 <henne> suseROCKs: the page is in the wrong namespace. the main namespace without a prefix is reserved as product brochure
11:16:04 <henne> The Main namespace (with no prefix) for the presentation of the latest openSUSE Distribution, think of it as the product brochure, for people who are new to openSUSE and maybe to Linux in general.
11:16:09 <suseROCKs> it should be under the marketing portal's namespace  correct?
11:16:44 <suseROCKs> how can we move it?   Do we do it ourselves or ask someone on wiki team to move it?
11:17:00 <henne> no. a namespace is something bigger then a pagename
11:17:11 <henne> there are essentially 3 namespaces in the openSUSE wiki
11:17:17 <gnokii> its a pot for a couple of pages
11:17:20 <henne> the main namespace i talked about above
11:17:25 <henne> The openSUSE community's openSUSE: namespace to collaboratively write on documentation for their projects and teams.
11:17:37 <henne> The support database's SDB: namespace for people who have a problem with the openSUSE distribution and seek written instruction on how to solve it.
11:18:36 <henne> so marketing material for people from the community to use belong to?
11:18:56 <gnokii> openSUSE:
11:19:06 <henne> correct
11:19:32 <henne> suseROCKs: everybody can move pages
11:21:08 <suseROCKs> henne,   ok so if you go to the top upper left corner....
11:21:25 <suseROCKs> you will see  wiki > openSUSE:Presentations
11:21:31 <henne> yes
11:21:39 <suseROCKs> and in the URL,  you don't see openSUSE:
11:22:09 <suseROCKs> so I'm having a disconnect here already as to where exactly it is now.
11:22:12 <henne> suseROCKs: that because you are on the redirect page that got left behind because someone moved the page
11:22:29 <henne> suseROCKs: because it was wrong in the first place...
11:22:56 <suseROCKs> that's not possible, henne.   I've never known you to be wrong.  :-)
11:23:43 <javier_> btw, just a suggestion... I think it would be better if we put on the wiki the language variant of the translated presentations... at least for ES and PT... (ie: es_ES, es_LAT, pt_PT, pt_BR, etc)
11:24:01 <suseROCKs> yes javier_
11:24:27 <suseROCKs> javier_,   any idea where those variants are currently stored?    Are they on the translated wikis now?
11:24:33 <javier_> this also happens with translated posters
11:25:11 <javier_> suseROCKs: we only have "es" on the wiki, afaik
11:25:50 <gnokii> javier_: I have not in mind to keep all posters in the wiki
11:26:06 <gnokii> a pointer to the git is enough
11:26:16 <suseROCKs> javier_,   http://pt.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations
11:26:21 <javier_> gnokii: I was referring to the presentations
11:26:26 <javier_> suseROCKs: exactly
11:26:53 <suseROCKs> javier_,  so you feel we should have  for example PT version both on the PT wiki and on the main wiki?
11:27:04 <javier_> gnokii: I mean that the translated posters should also say it's translated to this variant or the other, you know
11:27:45 <henne> javier_: translation projects say this in the wiki by adding the interwiki link :)
11:27:46 <javier_> suseROCKs: well, that's another possibility
11:27:55 <gnokii> yeah javier_ nothing speaks against that, a pointer means a link and u can write it down ;)
11:28:00 <suseROCKs> or maybe just a link put into the main page listing all the language available and point to those
11:28:20 <helen_au> hmm, what do I open an odp with
11:28:35 <javier_> helen_au: OOo
11:28:35 <gnokii> openoffice
11:28:38 <suseROCKs> helen_au,    Impress in openOffice
11:28:53 <terrorpup> morning
11:29:04 <suseROCKs> hiya terrorpup
11:29:06 <helen_au> ah. LXDE doesn't have those, just okular
11:29:19 <henne> please guys don't invent your own thing if there are already mechanisms in place for pointing to a different language
11:29:58 <suseROCKs> henne,   No worries.  That's why we're discussing here to figure out what exists already and what doesn't.     I'm just trying to clarify javier_'s question/suggestion
11:30:11 <javier_> I don't want to invent anythiing...
11:30:36 <henne> reload the page and look at the left navigation
11:30:38 <javier_> I haven't said anything about creating interwiki links
11:31:16 <javier_> I just said that the presentations wherever they are should say what language variant they were translated to
11:32:10 <henne> and you use a wiki page to list them so just use interwiki links :)
11:32:10 <javier_> the place for the presentations is another story
11:32:31 <javier_> ok
11:33:18 <javier_> henne:  you mean interwiki links to http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations ?
11:33:26 <henne> yes
11:33:47 <javier_> ok, so the presentations in pt should be moved to en.o.o
11:33:52 <henne> nooooooo
11:34:20 <suseROCKs> no what I think henne means is that if you're on $lang1 it should be easy to see its counterpart on $lang2
11:34:24 <henne> i just have added [[pt:openSUSE:Presentations]] to that page
11:34:28 <helen_au> I wonder if perhaps an in-depth look at Wiki structure and fixes needs to be scheduled for another time?
11:34:34 <henne> which creates a box on the left navigation
11:34:43 <henne> "In other languages"
11:34:51 <javier_> ok, sorry i missunderstood you
11:34:56 <javier_> I know
11:35:21 <javier_> so the translated versions go to whatever wiki and and interwiki link is added to the en.o.o wikipage
11:35:22 <gnokii> so short off for eat & meet
11:36:14 <henne> javier_: exactly
11:36:25 <javier_> ok
11:36:45 <simon123> "so the translated versions go to whatever wiki and and interwiki link is added to the en.o.o wikipage" - which means that you have files all over the place
11:37:11 <suseROCKs> simon123,   so what are you suggesting?
11:37:55 <simon123> there was gnokii's request to have single upload place and then you link from any wiki
11:38:26 <suseROCKs> and henne   is there a way for us to instantly know when there's a translated version of any given page we're looking at?   For example if I'm looking at a particular page and I wonder  hmm...  how many other languages is this particular page translated to?  What could I do then?
11:38:47 <henne> suseROCKs: look at the left box
11:39:10 <javier_> the leftbox is easy to miss
11:39:13 <henne> suseROCKs: thats as "instant" as it gets
11:39:16 <suseROCKs> ahh I see it now
11:39:38 <suseROCKs> javier_,   sure.  until you know it actually exists.  (learning curve which is not that difficult)    Once you know its there, you'll always look for it
11:40:14 <simon123> henne: cboltz mentioned once how to have single upload place (the wiki ML)
11:40:22 <terrorpup> getting some tea to wake up, I think suseROCKs set us his cold weather to wake.
11:40:29 <henne> simon123: we already have that afair
11:41:04 <simon123> henne: if we have that I missed announcement
11:41:30 <henne> http://download.opensuse.org/projects/
11:42:01 <henne> simon123: as usual this isnt announced
11:42:06 <simon123> how to link that from any wiki ?
11:42:10 <suseROCKs> javier_,    so, how much of your question got clarified now?  what missing gaps do you still see from your perspective?
11:42:23 <henne> simon123: simple file links?
11:42:51 <simon123> ok, and how to upload ?
11:43:09 <henne> simon123: as its not announce i have no friggn clue ;)
11:43:17 <henne> darix created it
11:43:20 <suseROCKs> Houston, we have a problem!   :-)
11:43:28 <suseROCKs> no not darix being the problem  :-)
11:43:35 <henne> well kind of...
11:43:36 <javier_> suseROCKs: yepp.
11:43:37 <simon123> :)
11:44:10 <henne> i guess it the usual "talk to darix" routine
11:44:22 <henne> to get something uploaded there
11:44:38 <suseROCKs> which makes me feel bad cuz we do ping him quite excessively, poor guy
11:45:38 <simon123> let we check how can we do that within wiki, so that interwiki links will work
11:46:17 <suseROCKs> javier_,   where are spanish versions of presentations currently stored?  or do none exist at this time?
11:46:37 <darix> henne: people request space
11:46:42 <darix> and they get an rsync module
11:46:47 <darix> and yes we havent announced it
11:46:49 <henne> simon123: the only reason we don't do that in the wiki i heard about are file size limitations
11:47:09 <darix> we created it before announcement because jos needed some hosting for files that got rejected by the wiki
11:47:13 <simon123> henne: we can raise that
11:47:24 <henne> simon123: sure...
11:47:42 <suseROCKs> what are the current size limits?
11:47:45 <javier_> suseROCKs: here http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations
11:47:46 <simon123> it is now 4 MB, and it could be whatever we set
11:48:09 <suseROCKs> can't we set it to 4 TB?
11:48:13 * suseROCKs ducks
11:48:21 <simon123> suseROCKs: not sure :)
11:48:49 <suseROCKs> javier_,   ok so I see a task.  :-)    Populate http://es.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations
11:48:57 <javier_> yepp :)
11:48:58 <simon123> darix: what are size limits on download.o.o ?
11:49:05 <helen_au> <aside> there's a lot of good images on Flickr too.....
11:49:28 <suseROCKs> helen_au,  yes
11:49:57 <darix> simon123: what do you mean?
11:50:07 <suseROCKs> helen_au,    perhaps a "tips and tricks for research" page that tells some marketeers where to start looking for material?
11:50:21 <suseROCKs> javier_,   may I note that you are taking on that assignment?
11:50:35 <simon123> darix: is there limit on file size that one can upload to download.o.o
11:50:47 <javier_> suseROCKs: sure
11:51:05 <suseROCKs> thanks
11:51:28 <helen_au> suseROCKs, that's a good idea
11:51:33 <darix> simon123: if you fill the disk i will get very angry
11:51:41 <darix> but other than that no
11:52:04 <gnokii> darix: I have there a specifical problem with upload to the wiki
11:52:07 <helen_au> I'd be interested to hear from other 'newer' people on how they've found the experience
11:52:11 <helen_au> of looking for materials
11:52:17 <helen_au> did they find what they were looking for>
11:52:23 <simon123> darix: how do I see how much room is there ?
11:52:30 <helen_au> maybe Etern4L ?
11:52:41 <terrorpup> thanks.
11:53:15 <darix> gnokii: it is just a problem with file size
11:53:17 <darix> nothing more
11:53:23 <terrorpup> I am working from home today, lupinstein may go away shortly I need to the link to pad
11:53:23 <darix> the wiki only allows 4MB
11:53:28 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   I think it gets confusing for all new people.   The wiki is certainly not easy to navigate, but once you get it (finally!)  it all starts to make sense thereafter.   It takes time.
11:53:37 <gnokii> no its a problem with the file type
11:53:47 <suseROCKs> What we want to figure out is how to shorten that learning curve.
11:54:14 <helen_au> actually getting a little bit off-topic from the wiki discussion but something I thought about the other day, was a 'what should I be reading' page
11:54:16 <darix> gnokii: Maximum file size: 4 MB (a file on your computer)
11:54:18 <darix> from
11:54:23 <darix> http://en.opensuse.org/Special:Upload
11:54:32 <darix> later
11:54:34 <helen_au> there's so much content - wikis, planet, news.... I'm not sure if I'm missing stuff
11:54:36 <darix> simon123: dunno
11:54:46 <gnokii> no darix isnt the problem the wiki looks to clever
11:54:57 <gnokii> I tried to upload an extended svg
11:54:59 <helen_au> so a guide to 'essential reading for new geeko-fans' would be nice
11:55:33 <henne> helen_au: what is a geeko-fan?
11:55:38 <helen_au> suseROCKs, yes that's true, I think I'm finally getting 'at home' with it myself, just occasionally run into road blocks
11:55:49 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   an interesting question.   I guess the question is more to be asked after identifying who you are  (the audience)
11:55:49 <henne> because depending on your definition the essentials change....
11:55:51 <helen_au> henne, I just made that up for new keen SUSE users
11:56:11 <gnokii> huhu izabelvalverde
11:56:17 <izabelvalverde> good afternoon all
11:56:27 <suseROCKs> Moin izabelvalverde
11:56:30 <simon123> gnokii: the problem is that svg rendering doesn't work
11:56:45 <gnokii> afternoon, thaugt is 10 a.m in Novo Hamburgo
11:56:46 <izabelvalverde> sorry about the time
11:56:58 <izabelvalverde> gnokii you are right
11:57:03 <gnokii> simon123: what does it not?
11:58:08 <terrorpup> helen, simon123 recommend what we make like a portal page with all links yesterday, when I thought was a good idea
11:58:24 <henne> helen_au: with all material (also with web pages) you have to define for which audience you want to publish. its publishing 101
11:58:44 <helen_au> great idea
11:59:06 <henne> so whatever you create you will never cover everybody...
11:59:11 <helen_au> true
11:59:11 <izabelvalverde> suseROCKs terrorpup I'm not sure if I'll be around longer so whatever help I can give please just tell me ok?
11:59:25 <helen_au> but having a central place to find things make life easier
11:59:26 <suseROCKs> izabelvalverde,  to bring you up to date,  we're discussing the navigability and proper usage of the wiki
11:59:26 <henne> i always understand, whenever i hang out here, that you strive for that
11:59:41 <terrorpup> izabelvalverde, will do, we are talk about the wiki at the moment
12:00:05 <suseROCKs> also list of suggested tasks are here  http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing
12:00:07 <javier_> btw, suseROCKs the presentations' filenames begin with an uppercase o
12:00:38 <henne> helen_au: didn't we just establish that central depends on who tries to find something? ;)
12:00:45 <suseROCKs> javier_,  we need a plugin that automatically fixes and slaps the hands of people who uppercased the O  :-)
12:01:34 <terrorpup> Ok when are at a point we can start talking about the items on the pad
12:01:40 <helen_au> henne, true, but then we can easily cherry-pick from a master list
12:01:55 <helen_au> if something is hidden in a link within a link....
12:02:00 <helen_au> we might not find it
12:02:11 <javier_> hehe
12:02:11 <suseROCKs> terrorpup,   we can start at any time.   If someone looks at the list of suggested assignments and wants to do something and has a question from there... just ask  :-)
12:02:22 <henne> you guys need to define what you want to do and what not
12:02:29 <henne> then everything else becomes easy...
12:02:33 <henne> in the wiki that is
12:02:59 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   I think for focus, you should think about that question specifically in terms of "where to start" for doing our job (in marketing)
12:05:02 <terrorpup> Ok, then let everyone please take 5 minutes to look at http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing
12:05:06 <helen_au> right now I"m not even sure what the question is.....
12:05:13 <helen_au> ok
12:05:17 <izabelvalverde> I suggested a point at ietherpad
12:05:28 <terrorpup> If there are questions we will take those first
12:05:39 <henne> helen_au: maybe http://en.opensuse.org/Category:Portals is what you are looking for
12:05:47 <terrorpup> thank you izabelvalverde
12:05:49 <henne> helen_au: a listing of all major topics in openSUSE
12:06:19 <suseROCKs> izabelvalverde,   which one?
12:06:40 <terrorpup> Model of Sponsor Letter
12:07:01 <izabelvalverde> line 34
12:07:09 <suseROCKs> ahh  good one
12:07:10 <javier_> suseROCKs: Introduce Yourself or a bit about yourself (talk is missing?)
12:07:23 <javier_> that's in the presentation
12:08:24 <jospoortvliet> izabelvalverde: maybe that's a point you could work on as it could be pretty useful
12:08:27 <izabelvalverde> terrorpup also I would like to add Code Of Conduct
12:08:29 <jospoortvliet> and to be honest, I never did that
12:08:33 <jospoortvliet> so it would help with the next conference...
12:08:36 <suseROCKs> javier_,   I think that was one of the assignments in last week's Ambassador list  for "how to make a good presentation"
12:08:37 <jospoortvliet> and you DO have experience :D
12:08:39 <terrorpup> for Marketing?
12:09:10 <suseROCKs> Code of Conduct should point to the Guiding Principles.
12:09:12 <gnokii> izabelvalverde: code fo conduct are the the ones with the african slang
12:09:27 * simon123 leaves
12:09:37 <terrorpup> izabelvalverde, I am not sure how we can Market that
12:09:51 <izabelvalverde> terrorpup yes for me since marketing means a way to show or represent a group
12:10:05 * henne too
12:10:12 <izabelvalverde> maybe an ambassador think
12:10:20 <izabelvalverde> you're right
12:10:31 <suseROCKs> oh   as in  how to best present yourself in public
12:10:37 <terrorpup> I had some thought like you izabelvalverde
12:10:42 <izabelvalverde> jospoortvliet I can do
12:11:12 <jospoortvliet> izabelvalverde: cool, super!
12:11:23 <jospoortvliet> izabelvalverde: and good points on CoC
12:11:29 <suseROCKs> brb
12:11:33 <gnokii> jospoortvliet: would there be a next one, because its a little bit lost of the focus ;)
12:13:55 <jospoortvliet> gnokii: could be, yes. Then again we should use the skills we have and Izabel's skills in this are very useful
12:14:01 * jospoortvliet is now hungry
12:14:05 * jospoortvliet will get some food
12:14:08 <suseROCKs> back
12:14:12 <gnokii> jospoortvliet: thats was not my point!
12:14:54 <gnokii> jospoortvliet: was a friendly reminder for try to setup the meeting u planned again
12:15:50 <jospoortvliet> aaah you mean news
12:15:52 <jospoortvliet> ?
12:15:56 <jospoortvliet> or next week collab meeting?
12:16:15 <gnokii> no I mean u planned once a meeting for conference and it didnt happend ;)
12:17:27 <helen_au> http://en.opensuse.org/Category:Marketing_resources
12:18:16 <terrorpup> hmm, is there a plugin that firefox needs for ietherpad?
12:18:31 <helen_au> I saw that too. don't think so.
12:19:03 <suseROCKs> terrorpup, I just noticed that a minute ago too and when I clicked to search for plugins none were found  :-)
12:19:07 <helen_au> marketing-artwork and marketing-presentations are both empty on portal page
12:19:38 <gnokii> helen_au: woot marketing-artwork?
12:20:55 <suseROCKs> there shouldn't be a "marketing-artwork" category.  it should point to the Artwork portal pages
12:21:15 <suseROCKs> otherwise we'll have too many redundant things
12:21:43 <izabelvalverde> terrorpup saw line 23 ;)
12:21:45 <gnokii> marketing-artwork is the redundany himself
12:22:07 <suseROCKs> gnokii,   you're not redundant.  :-)
12:22:19 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   where do you see marketing-artwork?
12:22:26 <gnokii> would be better I am redundant
12:22:33 <terrorpup> guys, I will brb, I need to dress my son, but I think are ready to start
12:22:40 <helen_au> http://en.opensuse.org/Category:Marketing_resources
12:23:11 <helen_au> see when you click on it, you get the banner links below, but the (0) doesn't invite a click
12:23:13 <helen_au> it looks empty
12:24:00 <gnokii> its a category helen_au
12:24:11 <helen_au> hey I'm just telling you what I see as numpty user
12:24:14 <gnokii> and brings u to pages like that one http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Banners
12:24:18 <helen_au> how many other people see that and don't click?
12:24:35 <helen_au> can we make the (0) go away?
12:24:38 <gnokii> and btw, have to kill most of that "banners"
12:24:54 <gnokii> and write protect the page after doing that
12:24:58 <helen_au> urgh ugly old banners
12:25:05 <javier_> I was going to say that ;)
12:25:10 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   ahhh    I get what you mean
12:25:24 <suseROCKs> the (0) is actually (o)  the letter  :-)
12:25:28 <gnokii> yeah lot of kids stuff and thats what happen u begin collect such things in the wiki
12:25:30 <helen_au> I realize if you're used to wikis you probably know it's the subcategory
12:25:51 <helen_au> but for me as a non-techy person, it looks like it's going to be a dead link
12:26:19 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   You're right.  It is misleading at first glance.  Question is, how do we resolve that?
12:26:38 <helen_au> dunno I don't know wikki-speak
12:26:50 <helen_au> some code cheat to get rid of the (0)
12:27:00 <suseROCKs> forget "wiki-speak"
12:27:24 <gnokii> helen_au: the count there says how many sub-categories exist
12:27:31 <helen_au> yes I understand that
12:28:14 <suseROCKs> maybe we should ask the wiki team if they can massage this to not display (0) when there's no count of sub categories
12:28:32 <suseROCKs> because you're right.  it is very misleading
12:29:08 <suseROCKs> and our wiki gurus are gone  :-)   I'll send a note to the wiki ML on this
12:29:19 <javier_> gnokii: that banners wikipage links to a place where hate is ok :(
12:29:37 <javier_> http://www.userbars.org/cat6.htm
12:30:18 <gnokii> javier_: as I said have to clean it up and write protect it after it
12:30:19 <helen_au> anyways I didn't mean to derail progress with more on wiki ajustments
12:30:28 <helen_au> we probably need to move on with materials
12:30:32 <helen_au> items on list and so forth
12:31:08 <javier_> gnokii: as a first measure, I'm deleting those links
12:32:04 <gnokii> ok
12:32:15 <gnokii> u can kill the dead link also
12:33:05 <terrorpup> javier_,  that userbars is a pop hell page
12:33:06 <javier_> sure
12:34:03 <helen_au> jeebus don't click that damn link!
12:34:17 <helen_au> userbars epic fail
12:34:25 <helen_au> what about a nice Firefox theme
12:34:28 <terrorpup> lucky I am not running windows
12:34:33 <helen_au> there's a couple of user-generated ones
12:34:35 <javier_> terrorpup: indeed
12:34:42 <helen_au> I"m on LXDE+firefox and still got popups
12:34:59 <terrorpup> you mean like the Firefox persona?
12:35:03 <helen_au> persona
12:35:05 <helen_au> that's the word
12:35:05 <javier_> gnokii: done
12:35:14 <gnokii> javier_: thx
12:35:25 <helen_au> I have a nice one done by someone in el salvador
12:35:41 <terrorpup> That would go under Items for personal use
12:35:47 <helen_au> oh, regarding things like success stories and tips
12:35:55 <helen_au> where would we post them to? Wiki again?
12:36:16 <javier_> gnokii: Edit page: block new and unregisted users, admins only.
12:36:22 <javier_> I mean or
12:36:28 <terrorpup> helen_au, I use one that is blue by Raul Liborio on all my means.
12:36:31 <helen_au> because a local lug had some really great reports on their Software Freedom day, and I'd like to ask them if  I can share it with opensuse
12:36:38 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   I would probably post it as a pdf or something that ambassadors can then print out and use at their events
12:36:44 <terrorpup> means = machine
12:37:10 * suseROCKs hopes carlos can come by today and work on the Banco do Brasil success story
12:37:53 <gnokii> javier_: when u do that I cant, I should not be admin I think so, can be I am I dont know yet but would be ok with me
12:38:24 <helen_au> suseROCKs, it's more like a tipsheet they'd read beforehand
12:38:40 <helen_au> things that they found worked at their event, what people asked about, what was popular
12:38:46 <suseROCKs> ahh
12:38:47 <terrorpup> ok, lets start with line 5
12:38:49 <helen_au> and also how 'not' to phrase some things
12:39:03 <helen_au> really good stuff and well written
12:39:11 <javier_> gnokii: you can ask fsundermeyer to make you admin
12:39:16 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   that's not what I was referring to as success stories.    As for tipsheets, we've been buildinig some of that in last week's ambassador day
12:39:24 <suseROCKs> For example, talking points page,  checklist, etc.
12:39:38 <terrorpup> Instrustion for Demon
12:39:40 <helen_au> so how would i make that accessible for people working on those things? mail to marketing list?
12:39:52 <terrorpup> sorry Instructions for Demo
12:40:07 <terrorpup> would anyone like to take this one, any thoughts
12:40:58 <suseROCKs> that actually is further elaborated further down in line 36
12:42:07 <helen_au> ok so you're not interested in hearing about LUG Software Freedom Day stall experiences then?
12:42:09 <suseROCKs> So it really breaks down into two areas:   1.  Demonstrations in presentations and tutorial sessions  and 2. Demonstrations at the booth
12:42:29 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   that should be as a report and it should also be published on news.o.o
12:43:01 <suseROCKs> helen_au,  and what we should do is keep a running list of all these event reports so taht future people can tick through the various reports until they get an idea of how others did it
12:43:01 <terrorpup> we should also come up with guide lines how how to do those as well
12:43:16 <helen_au> suseROCKs, no that's not what I mean, it's not suse-specific - it's general - but tips I think other presenters will find useful
12:43:32 <helen_au> so they might be useful to people compiling guidelines or resources
12:43:56 <helen_au> (yes more like your last comment)
12:43:57 <gnokii> helen_au: there exists a presentation ZEN in the wiki
12:44:24 <terrorpup> helen_au, I agree on the guidelines, we need to teach ppl how to do put the openSUSE brand on it.
12:44:42 <helen_au> terrorpup, fyi ...http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/persona/158811
12:45:58 <terrorpup> helen_au, this one i am using
12:45:59 <terrorpup> http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/persona/61519
12:46:06 * gnokii finds it funny that ppl they dont understand art & brand guidelines like to teach others
12:46:49 <terrorpup> guys, suseROCKs  will run the show for next 30mins, I have to take my son to school.
12:47:22 <terrorpup> but if we can, please let talk about line 5 and go down the list.
12:47:23 <helen_au> thanks pup
12:47:38 <terrorpup> be back in flash
12:48:02 <suseROCKs> actually we need to step back a bit....
12:48:15 <suseROCKs> we're all identifying lots of stuff but we need to do actual work today  :-)
12:48:48 <suseROCKs> and since helen_au is finding all kinds of good stuff we should be working on, I don't want people assuming she's going to do all the work.  :-)
12:49:10 <helen_au> lol sorry I've just got a big mouth :) I'll be quiet now
12:49:18 <suseROCKs> no no  dn't
12:49:20 <suseROCKs> don't
12:49:33 <suseROCKs> you've brought up good points that we need to hear about.
12:49:41 <suseROCKs> and it is "Collaboration" day
12:50:31 <helen_au> so what needs work?
12:52:32 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   pick and choose what you want from the list...  say  "I'll take this one" and we'll add your name to that task
12:52:55 <suseROCKs> or if there's something else you'd rather do that is marketing materials related, add to it
12:58:20 <helen_au> I could write something, not sure what. Brochures maybe, not wiki I hate wiki
12:58:31 <helen_au> I'm working on this article STILL ! http://piratepad.net/tpJmpiYeNG
12:58:44 <helen_au> which Rajko helped a lot with
13:00:33 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   then I would suggest sticking to that.  It's marketing related and you're already workinig on it
13:00:59 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   and we expect you to be done by midnight, Sydney time.
13:01:03 <suseROCKs> oops  its midnight now  :-)
13:01:19 <helen_au> lolz yeh my husband gave up and went to sleep!
13:01:33 <helen_au> he thinks I love my computer more than him!
13:01:51 <gnokii> helen_au: easy solution make a wallpaper with his face :D
13:02:04 <helen_au> heh
13:02:12 <suseROCKs> take an old keyboard and stick the keys onto his body
13:02:34 <suseROCKs> just don't tell us where you plug in that usb drive
13:02:39 <helen_au> bwahahaha
13:03:32 <helen_au> well I don't know that we've made much progress in last hour or two really, have we?
13:03:46 <suseROCKs> sure we have
13:03:54 <helen_au> is there something on that list that really is lacking?
13:03:57 <suseROCKs> have we gotten a lot done?  no.   But have we identified what has ailed us,  sure
13:04:05 <helen_au> for some things there is existing wiki pages
13:04:30 <suseROCKs> helen_au,   easiest thing to do then is to go through the existing stuff and see if its still relevant/appropriate
13:04:50 <suseROCKs> all things need updating from time to time and we easily become lax, especially when it comes to wikis
13:05:56 <suseROCKs> hey hey warlordfff!
13:06:02 <helen_au> warlordfff, hey kostas
13:06:17 <warlordfff> Hey
13:06:21 <warlordfff> how are you

13:35:11 <terrorpup> I know here in the states, they love the stuff tux and geeko
13:35:22 <terrorpup> we do have the cute one that europe has
13:35:27 <gnokii> sorry swag review, can it be that henne made clear last collaboration day what is there, so why is there such a thing again
13:35:28 <terrorpup> but they love them.
13:35:50 <gnokii> what u talking about we have the same ugly like u have
13:35:52 <terrorpup> the ipod man, not so hot.
13:36:25 <terrorpup> no, gnokii you geeko is a light green and has plastic eyes.
13:36:44 <terrorpup> our is dark green and switch eyes
13:37:09 <gnokii> how do u know that, can it be u know nothing but talking?
13:37:37 <terrorpup> because AJ told me when I asked why they look different
13:38:16 <terrorpup> plus, I have seen the swag the US guys have in the Novell office when they helped me out last year for SCALE
13:39:30 <gnokii> never seen one of the old ones, since year always get the same like u get, or I have to buy then at steiner. So an the end u say AJaeger told u bullshit?
13:41:07 <gnokii> FunkyPenguin: yeah
13:41:37 <FunkyPenguin> huh?
13:42:44 <terrorpup> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/geekoplush-300x225.jpg
13:42:47 <gnokii> icon list
13:43:58 <terrorpup> that's the ones I have that came from Salt Lake when Zonker was here, the ones I got from AJ came from europe didn't look like that
13:46:17 <gnokii> terrorpup: u dont understand as I said, I know which u mean u can buy them but u get them not from suse anymore for free
13:46:48 <terrorpup> gnokii, I just looked on the shop page and I don't see them there
13:46:57 <gnokii> ^^
13:47:37 <gnokii> http://www.cd-rom.de/home.htm?/k/431/431659.shtml
13:48:02 <gnokii> that AJ brought u an old geeko means not we have them
13:48:03 <terrorpup> yea, that the ones AJ send me
13:48:37 <gnokii> ^^
13:49:06 <terrorpup> you guys still have the ones I posted? Because the one posted I assume the new ones, and no one in the US had seen them
13:49:48 <gnokii> there comes the man
13:50:32 <warlordfff> gnokii something strange happened
13:51:20 <gnokii> terrorpup I think henne told last collab day what is right now there on swag stuff, when u would know that not all of the conference visitors had one in there package u would know that
13:51:46 <warlordfff> its the second time I read something you wrote and agree with you
13:52:35 <warlordfff> not totaly but I thing you are mostly right
13:53:42 <warlordfff> anyway sorry for the off-subject notice
13:54:14 <warlordfff> going back to my food
13:54:33 <terrorpup> warlordfff, I like your doc, but you might want to tailor it for LUG, a lot of them met at schools (esp. here is States).
13:54:52 <warlordfff> ???
13:55:06 <terrorpup> your launch party doc.
13:55:09 <terrorpup> sec
13:55:19 <warlordfff> yes that I got
13:55:45 <warlordfff> 'but you might want to tailor it for LUG' that I don't get
13:56:10 * gnokii strange I wrote a launch party tutorial long time ago, and I am sure it doesnt matter if it is in schools or something other place
13:58:11 <warlordfff> gnokii what I wrote has nothing to do whith what you wrote
13:58:30 <warlordfff> the only common is the title
14:01:54 <warlordfff> I wrote about what the organizer of the party should give attention to the time of the party and how to make people feel comfortable and other such things
14:02:41 <terrorpup> gnokii, is your document, where the link for it.
14:03:23 <warlordfff> http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO
14:03:40 <warlordfff> I believe this is gnokii's document
14:03:54 <warlordfff> right?
14:04:43 <gnokii> yeah then complete it but I thaught it was longer once
14:05:41 <warlordfff> mmm
14:06:46 <warlordfff> I wouldn' t know that, anyway,as I said it has almost nothing to do with your document
14:08:47 <gnokii> sounds strange to put information behind the same headline and then say has nothing to do with things they are under teh same headline ;)
14:10:15 <warlordfff> If you read it you will understand why
14:10:39 <warlordfff> want a copy?
14:11:46 <gnokii> not yet no time
14:12:25 <warlordfff> ok
14:12:43 <suseROCKs> back!   Snow shoveled, body defrosted,
14:12:51 <terrorpup> ok
14:13:01 <suseROCKs> terrorpup,  how's it going
14:13:08 <terrorpup> you must have taken everyone with you
14:13:14 <terrorpup> it got quite
14:13:27 <suseROCKs> looks like you guys chattered a bit while I was away
14:13:32 <gnokii> warlordfff: u can send it but u not get direct feedback
14:13:41 <terrorpup> warlordfff send me launch party doc
14:14:25 <terrorpup> me and gnokii talked about stuff geekos, because of publict saying we need more swag
14:14:58 <warlordfff> gnokii ok, and I must tell you  its has space for corrections
14:15:46 <gnokii> if u think so do it
14:17:04 <terrorpup> suseROCKs, no one has added anything to pad, so I think it safe to start going over asking ppl to take on task, what do you think.
14:18:56 <suseROCKs> sure
14:19:13 <warlordfff> sent
14:21:56 <suseROCKs> terrorpup,   give warlordfff the task of rallying in more Greeks to today's event like he did last time  ;-)
14:22:25 <warlordfff> well
14:22:35 <warlordfff> people are comming
14:22:42 <terrorpup> warlordfff time to bring the greeks
14:22:57 <warlordfff> one is here 3 more are about to come in the next 3-4 hours
14:23:15 <warlordfff> with me we are two
14:23:16 <terrorpup> break out the Oozo
14:24:04 <FunkyPenguin> gnokii, oh crap - i'll get it to you today
14:24:07 <FunkyPenguin> thanks for the nudge
14:31:33 <terrorpup> ok ppl
14:32:01 <terrorpup> lets see who wanting to take on tasks
14:33:42 <terrorpup> gnokii, I like you to take one. Line 25 --Offical Logos and Clip Art that can be use for marketing, make sure all art is update.
14:33:56 <gnokii> declined
14:34:23 <gnokii> fist there re official logos, second what cliparts?
14:34:29 <gnokii> third no time
14:35:39 <terrorpup> o..k..
14:36:41 <terrorpup> warlordfff: you think you can take two items
14:37:53 <terrorpup> Line 28 Launch Parties and line 48 openSUSE ( How to demonstrate)
14:37:54 <warlordfff> me and creating art= Not a good idea except if there is some kind of sculpturing involved, sorry
14:38:09 <warlordfff> oh
14:38:20 <warlordfff> wait a moment to tell you
14:38:33 <terrorpup> no, I didn't think that. That why I asked Gnokii, since does a lot of art.
14:38:45 <warlordfff> ok missunderstood
14:38:54 <terrorpup> no worries
14:39:38 <warlordfff> for line 28 I could do some work but surrelly this calls for more than one person to do it
14:40:00 <terrorpup> true
14:40:12 <warlordfff> for line 48
14:40:25 <warlordfff> - openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e
14:40:28 <terrorpup> but you can take Gnokii doc and yours an lay a good ground works to start from
14:40:40 <terrorpup> sorry 46
14:40:45 <suseROCKs> warlordfff,  we have some material in existence.   gnokii wrote some good articles on this.   Basically what we should simply do is review and make sure everything is up to date and move on.  And make sure it is properly found on the wiki
14:41:23 <warlordfff> terrorpup confussed 46 or 48?
14:41:40 <terrorpup> yes, I looked too quick
14:42:06 <terrorpup> you don't want to learn on to help teachers warlordfff?
14:43:07 <warlordfff> suseROCKs agree I could expand gnokii's article and develope it more to some pionts but people must give feedback after that starts and correct it where needed
14:43:24 <warlordfff> terrorpup no
14:43:34 <warlordfff> I didn't meant that
14:43:37 <warlordfff> wait
14:43:45 <terrorpup> thank you Kostas as always
14:44:00 <warlordfff> I meant you are talking to me about talking line 46 or line 48?
14:44:23 <terrorpup> I was talking about line 46
14:44:49 <terrorpup> but hand sometmie doesn't work with my brain
14:44:52 <warlordfff> for line 46 and 48 I could make a team effort with others from the Greek team
14:45:20 <warlordfff> we made some thoughts about it anyway yesterday
14:45:32 <warlordfff> and talked about it
14:45:41 <warlordfff> in xariseto festival
14:45:59 <warlordfff> so I could try something
14:46:11 <warlordfff> with the rest of the tem
14:46:15 <warlordfff> with the rest of the team
14:46:41 <terrorpup> cool, I know a guy here called James Taylor, he live in the state above me, that I met that does a lot of work on Education stuff, I want to see if I can get him to help out
14:48:55 <warlordfff> ok
14:49:14 <warlordfff> anyone else could make a try,the more the better
15:05:11 <terrorpup> guys, I am here, I just got page need to look at a server
15:25:36 <warlordfff> terrorpup ping
15:25:43 <terrorpup> yes

16:12:19 <suseROCKs> hey CarlosRibeiro    Got a question for you
16:12:54 <suseROCKs> those cube designs you made.   Do they get printed on perforated paper or just regular sheets?
16:14:07 <terrorpup> think about some of those for SCALE
16:14:39 <suseROCKs> yes,  trying to figure out the budget for them.   But need to know if CarlosRibeiro used special printing or how it works
16:15:32 <CarlosRibeiro> hello suseROCKs how long without news from you. are you ok?
16:15:33 <terrorpup> suseROCKs and CarlosRibeiro are they update to 11.3? Because my sheet was for 11.2

16:20:25 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   What's the title of your SCALE submission?
16:20:26 <CarlosRibeiro> no more than 4 , Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black....
16:20:45 <CarlosRibeiro> something like opensource in Brazil
16:20:49 <terrorpup> by the way, a bit off topic by last night I set up my three monitors with sygenry and loving it.
16:21:13 <terrorpup> http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing
16:21:16 * suseROCKs swaps terrorpup's monitors around to confuse his synergy mouse pointer  :-D
16:21:17 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup:  I used this long ago for doing classrooms, synergy really show
16:21:58 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup:  nice, give some seconds to check what I could hep, over there
16:22:31 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   I'll include you in the thread of the SCALE committee on the next discussion
16:22:37 <terrorpup> opensuse 11.2 <--> opensuse 11.3 <--> Fedora 12
16:22:40 <bugbot> Fedora bug 12 in Red Hat Linux (AfterStep) "With and Without password screensavers are messed up" [Medium,Closed: currentrelease] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/12
16:22:49 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs:  fine
16:23:04 <suseROCKs> lol terrorpup   you confused bugbot  :-)
16:23:10 <terrorpup> yes, I noticed
16:23:33 * suseROCKs files a bug against bugbot
16:23:51 <terrorpup> fedora 14
16:23:54 <bugbot> Fedora bug 14 in Red Hat Linux (kernel) "Sound Modules Appear to be missing" [Medium,Closed: currentrelease] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/14
16:23:56 <javier_> lol
16:24:04 <terrorpup> wow
16:24:14 <terrorpup> we have a fedora bugbot
16:24:57 <suseROCKs> well  bugbot ties into several bugzllas.  Useful for the dev teams
16:27:47 <terrorpup> that's cool, do get me wrong
16:29:00 <terrorpup> CarlosRibeiro, what are you planning to do at SCALE
16:33:55 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup: firs I planning to have a lot fun :D
16:34:32 <CarlosRibeiro> second I would like to talk about what we are doing here for public and private schools using opensource
16:36:07 <suseROCKs> anyone know how you can verify trim sizes in gimp?
16:37:03 <suseROCKs> uh oh  CarlosRibeiro1 is on 3G again  :-)
16:38:04 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs:  you can click on "Image" > "Resize Image"
16:38:18 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs:  yes now I'm 3G connection
16:38:20 <CarlosRibeiro> :D
16:38:21 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   yeah that part I know.  But I'm asking about trim sizes
16:38:40 <suseROCKs> for printing purposes.  making sure that the edges are according to printer specs
16:38:49 <terrorpup> he didn't send me the link
16:40:13 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs:  I do not understand about trim size, sorry
16:41:18 <gnokii> CarlosRibeiro: simple
16:41:59 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   when sending to printers, you have to make sure there's no bleed on edges.  So if you have for example a 1.5 inch image, the printer might ask that the image be contained within 1.25 inches
16:42:41 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: humm now I got
16:42:51 <suseROCKs> Trim size!   :-)
16:43:03 <gnokii> CarlosRibeiro: what he try to tell u is that u left enough border space for the printer
16:43:51 <suseROCKs> so gnokii   Any tips on how to measure that in gimp?
16:43:58 <gnokii> gimp?
16:44:09 <suseROCKs> yes
16:44:30 <nmarques> http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/13/last-indicator-builds/
16:44:32 <nmarques> ;)
16:44:39 <CarlosRibeiro> I quite sure under "Image" we can see something like canvas size
16:44:43 <nmarques> so... now openSUSE can look like Ubuntu ;P
16:45:10 <gnokii> CarlosRibeiro: if u need help ping me
16:45:32 <CarlosRibeiro> gnokii: ;) always
16:46:17 <CarlosRibeiro> specially because you never sleep, and you are always here to help others :)
16:46:25 <gnokii> two thing work with inkscape for the resizibilty and then export what u created as 300dpi pic and import it to scribus
16:46:26 <CarlosRibeiro> gnokii:  equals zombi
16:46:51 <gnokii> CarlosRibeiro: u get something wrong I am here that others go away ;)
16:47:40 <CarlosRibeiro> ;)
16:50:44 <gnokii> so CarlosRibeiro if u not can do it send it to me
16:54:54 <CarlosRibeiro> gnokii: ok thanks a lot
16:56:17 <CarlosRibeiro> question about success case
16:57:11 <CarlosRibeiro> does we have any paper to send to some company to make us able to use their case as our success case?
16:57:38 <CarlosRibeiro> example, I would like to send the success case proposal to some company that already use openSUSE
16:58:11 <CarlosRibeiro> to let they to think about and sign that paper and send back to the marketing team
16:58:31 <CarlosRibeiro> this success case proposal, must have some key questions like
16:59:18 <CarlosRibeiro> why do you decided to move to openSUSE? what beneficies do you get moving to openSUSE?
16:59:59 <CarlosRibeiro> did you need to create a kind of a Training course as part of this migration? ....
17:00:05 * gnokii hates bug buddy
17:00:40 <CarlosRibeiro> so they will ready all openSUSE success casse proposal and decide if they allow us to publish that case or not
17:00:56 <CarlosRibeiro> read not ready
17:01:23 <terrorpup> CarlosRibeiro, do companies in Brazil use openSUSE or SLE?
17:02:21 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup: we use booth
17:02:47 <terrorpup> ok
17:03:16 <CarlosRibeiro> depends of several needs, like if the system is in production or nt, if the system is for homologate, if the comany need to be comply with some regulamentations
17:03:25 <CarlosRibeiro> like COBIT, Itil, Sox, HiPPA
17:03:47 <CarlosRibeiro> depends, but for sure, where have SLE have openSUSE
17:04:01 <nmarques> do they use openSUSE for Oracle DB deployment ? :)
17:04:38 <CarlosRibeiro> nmarques: of course this is up to the "customer"
17:04:52 <CarlosRibeiro> I do not recomend
17:05:05 <CarlosRibeiro> but for DNS, FTP, APACHE, ....
17:05:12 <nmarques> neither does Oracle ;)
17:05:20 <nmarques> at least no support
17:05:59 <CarlosRibeiro> sometimes they don't need support, they already have smart guys to support their craziest decisios
17:06:01 <CarlosRibeiro> ehehe
17:06:10 <CarlosRibeiro> pretty common here in brazil
17:06:21 <nmarques> yeah
17:06:36 <nmarques> that's why PT Inova� was in technical bankrupcy after 6 months ;)
17:06:36 <CarlosRibeiro> some companies does not buy subscriptions but invest in training
17:07:30 <CarlosRibeiro> so does we have any paper to be used as sucess case proposal or not?
17:08:26 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup: about openSUSE 911
17:08:45 <CarlosRibeiro> terrorpup: are yu talking about something similar this http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/17802.html
17:08:50 <CarlosRibeiro> for openSUSE
17:12:01 <gnokii> openSUSE 911 means that we become terrorists?
17:12:57 <terrorpup> I was talk about a card we could pass out at fest with all the import links
17:12:58 <CarlosRibeiro> gnokii: ehehe maybe we can use openSUSE Band-Aid
17:13:04 <CarlosRibeiro> fo fix any problem
17:13:12 <terrorpup> here in the states 911 the number you call for help
17:13:24 <Dominian> what are we nick naming now?
17:13:31 <terrorpup> maybe 411 would be better
17:13:51 <terrorpup> sense 411 is the number we call for informations
17:13:53 <gnokii> u can call it emergency card, but u can call maybe a cab with the number in germany
17:15:11 <terrorpup> I will remember that next time I am in Germany
17:17:58 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   earlier we were wondering if you'd like to write up the success story about banco do brasil
17:18:54 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: sure but most right is no me to write anything
17:19:11 <CarlosRibeiro> but send the sucecess case proposal with some guide
17:19:21 <CarlosRibeiro> to let they write
17:19:42 <suseROCKs> say again?
17:19:43 <CarlosRibeiro> and send back to us to be published
17:20:07 <suseROCKs> CarlosRibeiro,   you're saying to have the customer write the success story?
17:20:19 <terrorpup> no time, what you up to these days then
17:20:28 <CarlosRibeiro> if I write the sucess case for Banco do Brasil will have not the same impact as if Banco do Brasil CIO writes
17:20:36 <suseROCKs> no
17:20:58 <suseROCKs> you've seen success stories, even the ones Novell publishes for their clients
17:21:10 <CarlosRibeiro> at least a letter to send to they to let us write
17:21:27 <CarlosRibeiro> so before we start to write anything we need to be allowed to do that
17:21:30 <suseROCKs> All you need to do is write a short article and interview key people there who were involved and before final publication ask for their review and approval
17:21:41 <suseROCKs> well yes,   that's where you come in   :-)
17:22:15 <luizmachado> ping CarlosRibeiro
17:22:22 <suseROCKs> you're familiar with the people, you're familiar with the story already.    Connect the dots into a nice layout
17:22:22 <CarlosRibeiro> luizmachado: pong
17:22:39 <CarlosRibeiro> suseROCKs: ;) roger that
17:23:12 <suseROCKs> you've touted Banco for a long time.  Now let's see it on paper  :-)
17:23:18 <suseROCKs> ok I have to run out for a bit....
17:23:25 * suseROCKs hands the keys over to terrorpup
17:24:14 <luizmachado> CarlosRibeiro: How's are the tasks ?
17:24:40 <terrorpup> luizmachado,  we need people take on some
17:24:45 <terrorpup> you like to help out.
17:25:27 <luizmachado> terrorpup: I'm ready
17:26:04 <terrorpup> cool which one
17:26:16 <CarlosRibeiro> luizmachado: http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/oS-Collab-Marketing
17:26:47 <CarlosRibeiro> really nice to see you have ready to put your hands dirt, thanks a lot luizmachado
17:36:00 <terrorpup> going to get lunch
17:38:28 <luizmachado> CarlosRibeiro: I'm going to write an article about Suse studio, unfortunately we don't have any article in Portuguese about it.
17:38:41 <luizmachado> I think !
17:44:25 <CarlosRibeiro> luizmachado: I believe alexandre has made some
17:44:36 <CarlosRibeiro> luizmachado: do you remember he from Latinoware?
17:45:03 <luizmachado> CarlosRibeiro: yes, aledr :D
17:45:10 <CarlosRibeiro> that's it
17:45:29 <CarlosRibeiro> but now that I'm think better he has made a article about OBS
17:45:34 <CarlosRibeiro> not Studio
17:45:35 <CarlosRibeiro> ;)
17:46:27 <luizmachado> I can try !
17:47:20 <CarlosRibeiro> luizmachado: sure if you like I will be here to help in case you need some help
17:49:03 <luizmachado> I'll find a page about it to translate
18:01:32 <suseROCKs> back!
18:01:35 <terrorpup> wb suseROCKs
18:05:45 <suseROCKs> too cold out there terrorpup
18:05:55 <terrorpup> yes, 26 F
18:06:05 <suseROCKs> that's warm  :-)
18:06:35 <terrorpup> sorry I need weather between 70 to 80
18:07:23 <suseROCKs> its 14F now  and wind chill puts it at -3 F
18:07:57 <terrorpup> with the wind here it feels like 13 F
18:08:13 <suseROCKs> quit competing, you lose!  :-)
18:08:29 <suseROCKs> although it could be said in Atlanta, since that's not the norm, its feeling much colder than for us
18:08:54 <terrorpup> there is a reason Atlanta is called Hotlanta not the windy city
18:08:54 <suseROCKs> heck, it was only 3 weeks ago when CarlosRibeiro saw me swimming in the ocean like I was Shamu the Whale
18:09:35 <suseROCKs> terrorpup,   You do know that "Windy City" has nothing to do with the wind in Chicago and that Chicago isn't even in the top 10 windiest places in the US?
18:12:22 <gnokii> it means more all ther have some problems with her digestion
18:12:40 <terrorpup> ah, I been to Chicago a lot, I know what the term "The Hawk is out", means I got family around Greys Lake
18:13:44 <terrorpup> so why is the Windy City then
18:14:11 <suseROCKs> terrorpup,   it was a term given by a journalist in the early 1900s having to do with politicians blowing a lot of hot air
18:14:50 <suseROCKs> however, when you're downtown, it does feel extremely windy.  But that's because the wind from the lake is amplified between the skyscrapers causing a lot of wind tunnels
18:15:27 <terrorpup> yea, I froze my butt on Michigan Ave.
18:17:04 <suseROCKs> took me a few years to get used to the weather when I came back from CA after 15 years.    Freezing in winters, and humid in summers.
18:18:03 <gnokii> http://img.susepaste.org/38332343
18:19:47 <gnokii> he nmarques as I said u a secret spy from ubuntu now u use a lilac wallpaper too :D
18:20:03 <suseROCKs> gnokii,    it's pretty, but I'm not sure what it represents
18:20:39 <suseROCKs> and that reminds me gnokii   I was going to ask you today.  Do we have any holiday geekos?  like Geeko in a santa hat or something?
18:23:32 <gnokii> plz go to henne, he tells u something about drawings from me
18:29:18 <gh0stwalker> ? why do we need to tell him
18:29:43 <gh0stwalker> sorry, but do you know him?

18:32:39 <baezesteban> every all
18:34:08 <gnokii> hi baezesteban
18:34:10 <warlordfff> hi
