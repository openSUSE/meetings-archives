<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">16:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the Ambassador Collaboration Day did start something on that.   I'm not sure if its fully completed yet.

<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> and me use that (hum) for frOSCamp :-)
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:29:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> I know, buts what always happen here creating new pages without looking for existance ;)
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">16:30:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> probably because the pages wasn't easy to find
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">16:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> a sitemap for sure would help
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">16:31:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">izabelvalverde:</span> don't forget, it's just a dream ...
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">16:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> I think that 'events' should actually be a more visible sub project
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">16:31:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> wiki with sitemap sorry
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">16:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> take a look on it
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">16:32:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> tigerfoot dreams can drive us to somewhere ;)
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">16:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so the relevant issue here is making the event list more prominent and maintained
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">16:32:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> return to topics, and make this meeting productive :-)
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">16:33:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, and advertise it more so everyone knows it exists ;)
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">16:33:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> this should be something the ambassador team should be updating diligently and I'll ask them to keep an eye on it.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">16:33:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, thats probably the main point... if people know it exists, most likely they will use it more and keep it more updated
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">16:33:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">16:33:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   that's the same as "more prominent"  :-)
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">16:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> and btw there are plenty more events to speak about as SCAL adn FOSDEM
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">16:34:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> well that was a question earlier, are there events we need to know about in the near future to get ready for?
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">16:34:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> gnokii of course ther is but can be talk in next month meeting
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">16:34:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I'm planning to organize with a future ambassador for Portugal
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, one event in Porto for May/June 2011
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">16:35:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">izabelvalverde:</span> no, not really
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">16:35:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is that something that needs to be nailed down soon?  Deadlines, etc.?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">16:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I would like love to have support for it, but I'll get back to that later once we've defined things ;)
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">16:35:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   good idea.    And we'll get you support where we can.    Defining what you have in mind and how youw ant to deliver it will help us support you better.
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">16:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> gnokii why? If any will happen soon it's ok otherwise isn't a good idea to talk right now since doesn't have many people attending
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:36:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we'll try to get financed locally on local industry to bring 2 or 3 people to a University for some talks

<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">16:50:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> so we all agree that these 5,384 tasks we talked about before CarlosRibeiro logged in should be assigned to him for completion ASAP?
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">16:50:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then copy to the wiki
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">16:50:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">16:50:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> +1 :D
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">16:51:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, sry to disagree... but like I said, I'm finishing that one and submiting it to project :)
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">16:51:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> jospoortvliet  suseROCKs +1 :D
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">16:51:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> it doesn't make sense to split work and do it twice
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">16:51:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> no proeblem, where is the list
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">16:51:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> haha
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">16:51:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,    over there
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">16:51:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, I think I will have more success in bringing people from other sub-projects to a wikipage than to a piratepad ;)
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">16:51:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> and you won't see many ppl contribute on the wiki believe me, its too much of a barier compared to a quick etherpad
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">16:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> oh looks like we think very different on that one :D
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">16:52:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> haha
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">16:52:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> I'll push this my way
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">16:52:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> anyway, both ways would be pull and you can forget that you need to push
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">16:52:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> and if people laugh on my face
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">16:52:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> if etherpad is better for that try to stick that ... for example I can add the release date more easily than on the wiki
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">16:52:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,    TBH,  i was pretty resistant when jospoortvliet came along and advocated etherpads.   I thought he was nuts.   But now,  I can't live without them.   People in the Project have been migrating to it thanks to jospoortvliet
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">16:52:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> then they can promote their own shit ;)
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">16:52:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> contact ppl and ask them specific questions then add it to a list
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">16:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> etherpad link ?
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">16:53:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I suggest using ietherpad though.  It seems to be 1,000% more stable than piratepad
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">16:53:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> (so we can have it inside log too )
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">16:53:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/4
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">16:53:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, the problems doesn't seem to 'us', but 'them', the rest of the project ;)
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">16:53:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> we can link to the etherpad on the wiki
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">16:53:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   I *am* referring to the rest of the project  :-)
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">16:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> really it's much more convenient - no login required, no difficult markup. Most community members (incl developers) don't like wiki's...
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">16:53:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I am not going to dig changelogs and stuff to find out what people want promoted... if they can't speak for themselves, I don't care.. .less work for me ;)
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">16:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> urgh jimmac thinks really like an fedora now
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">16:54:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> there are several teams that I observe lately that are using it.   jospoortvliet is contagious!  :-)
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">16:54:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so we're getting off again.... back to topic
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">16:54:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> well if we don't know the features and ppl don't tell us we either have to do the work ourselves or have a very incomplete list. I opt for trying to push ppl then finish it ourselves. That's what the meeting in beginning feb is for
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">16:55:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we have priorities we need to identify for 2011.  One of them obviously is 11.4(12).   And there are other things that we may feel are a priority as well
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">16:55:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, and I opt for every project to report to us the stuff ;)
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">16:55:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, if you offer yourself to do it... they won't change a thing
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">16:55:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> sure. and if they don't we do  it ourselves... we don't have to offer that obviously...
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">16:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> So let's get that stuff listed as well.  Things that go beyond 11.4.  After all, we're more than just a distro, we're a project and we have many things going on at all times.
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">16:55:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, then people might learn next time and start reporting ;)
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">16:56:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, then we laugh on their faces :)
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">16:56:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> lets move ahead plz ;)
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">16:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> nmarques,   I can tell you that developers tend to not want to spend time on reports, especially to marketing folks.   It's always like pulling teeth.   But your presence on those teams does help to gather and alleviate that.
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">16:57:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, I'll stick with the GNOME people ;)
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">16:57:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, dont' care about the rest
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">16:57:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> so look at the wiki page and tell me if you're OK with the text I put above
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">16:57:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> linking to http://manugupt1.ietherpad.com/4 as temporary working ground
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">16:57:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we merge with the rest
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:57:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, but if we don't define a work methodology for it
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">16:58:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, we will always be in trouble and won't have time to work things as we would like
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">16:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, so we need to push them against reality
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">16:58:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you know what guys... we can continue to iron out the technical details here, but let's get back to the high-level overview so we don't lose on other subjects in the time frame
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">16:58:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, if that fails... then we go to board or boosters
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">16:58:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> you have a point here, KDE and GNOME have feature lists they keep updated. We have openFATE however for this release it wasn't used because it had technical issues. For next release there will be a process: openFATE
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">16:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> u not the first one who tell him that
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">16:58:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, if that fails... then we can try to push to Novell ;)
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:58:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> suseROCKs, and if no one has the intestinal fortitude to do it... I don't mind pushing this to the highest ranks possible
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:58:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> be careful otherwise, he begin to tell stories
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:59:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> shut up or go away
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:59:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> no need to create trouble here again
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">16:59:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sigh
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">16:59:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> nmarques has a good point
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">16:59:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's move on to the subset topic of this topic....
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">16:59:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> its the truth
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">16:59:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and openFATE will make it possible in the future
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">16:59:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, dude... openFATE sucks
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">16:59:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, openFATE is what people want
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">16:59:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, our release features we what we deliever

<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">16:59:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> it has seen quite some improvements and if it's not good enough than we should try to fix it. Wiki's don't work very well for this
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">16:59:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> what we deliever != what people want
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">17:00:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> ;)
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">17:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> openFATE should track feature completion dude incl release targets etc
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">17:00:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it does
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">17:00:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but only since recent
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">17:00:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> sorry suseROCKs
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">17:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, but really, if people want marketing to promote their projects
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">17:00:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, the least they can do is to provide us the info
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">17:01:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, that sounds reasonable to me
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">17:01:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'm just letting you guys air out and release the steam for a few seconds more so we can concentrate productively on the next subject.  :-)
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">17:01:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> this is  just your opinion I dont believe all developers around the globe share the same opinion as you have about openFATE
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">17:01:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, while sending non-tech marketing people to dig out tech info like features is a nightmare
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">17:01:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> now breathe deeply for 5 seconds folks...
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">17:01:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> I'm not disagreeing, I'm just saying it won't happen. Tried it in KDE too...
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">17:01:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, then don't advertise KDE ;)
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">17:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> not that we shouldn't try
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">17:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, they will change their mind
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">17:02:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> cool off nmarques
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">17:02:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> he. I doubt it's different in any project
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">17:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> they should figure out that it's THEIR interest into having better representation
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">17:02:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, it seems to be different on GNOME
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">17:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, they promptly offered themselfs to help
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">17:02:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> nmarques, well, most projects like gcc, kernel dont need our marketing. we need their service. so it is upto us to get those features :-)
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">17:02:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> but they don't seriously dude you're carrying water to the see here, preaching to the choir etc. I agree that they should but they won't. Engineers are not marketing ppl, they don't care
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">17:02:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ENOUGH....  no more about this KDE vs GNOME here...   we're totally off topic now..  Stop
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">17:02:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, so because it doesnt work for KDE
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">17:02:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> it doesn't work for ANY project nmarques
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">17:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, doesn't mean it doesn't work for all the rest
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">17:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> it works for none and openSUSE is not different than others
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">17:03:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, you are wrong
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">17:03:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> u should learn that u not have to stop others always in a discussion!
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">17:03:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, and you are starting from a position of someone who is already defeated
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">17:04:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> let me quote Coolo here when I told him to blog more: "well I believe there are people who do work and people who read blogs. I don't want to waste my time on that". Imagine that I just suggested to copy-paste his frequent "state of openSUSE" reports on project to his blog.
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">17:04:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, take this issue to the board, boosters and novell if you have to

<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">17:04:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, but we can't promote anything if we don't get the info
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">17:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   I do when it goes off topic which is what has happened here.   Why should the rest of us sit here and waste our time when we have other things to do and stopped what we do to attend the meeting?
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">17:04:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> yes please :D
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">17:04:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nmarques:</span> what the point with this kind of discussion, in my opinion KDE X GNOME will not help us anyway now
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">17:04:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> gnokii agreed sorry

Not everybody as the talent for speaking you have :-)
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">17:05:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> nor do they care...
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">17:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">17:06:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> what should we do at the marketing hackfest

<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">17:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> this is marketing
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">17:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nmarques&gt;</span> this is something very different

<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">17:06:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> The very first thing we need to know is  a) Who is interested in going that can contribute  and b) what are the acceptable dates.
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">17:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> If we don't have a general idea soon, it will be hard for us to actually organize the time and place
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">17:06:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I propose to do it beginning of feb

<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">17:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> pick another time and date
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">17:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> for the hotel and travel ;-)
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">17:08:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> we certainly can't do it super well, but we have to do something ...
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">17:08:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I'm buying ;-)
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">17:08:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> besides if we plan it in jan, ppl from outside of germany will have even more trouble coming there
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">17:08:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> jospoortvliet I'll apply to attend
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">17:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> mmh, jospoortvliet who say we have there to hack on 11.4/12.0 marketing?
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">17:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">izabelvalverde:</span> cool
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">17:08:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> well it's not a rule it's a suggestion :D
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">17:08:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> izabelvalverde me too
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">17:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, i am lost. when is it okay financially for you ? After Feb  ?
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">17:09:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I think it would make sense to focus on that but we should definitely do other things too like drink beer hehe
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">17:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> from 1 feb to 30 april
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">17:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I can't fund it befor or after, I reserved the money in that time
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">17:09:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, ah okay. good.
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">17:09:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> already we have to give the ambassadors some time to prepare the launch parties, we have them to give stuff when they begin with it, some doing events before the launch come, so its to late for 11.4/12.0
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">17:09:49 </span><span class="nka">* psankar</span> <span class="ac">votes for late in the april</span>
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">17:10:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I don't see why it would be too late.    We should be starting to work on 11.4 now anyway and February is an excellent mid-point date to see how we're progressing before the march release
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">17:10:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> well it is for sending stuff to them like posters and planning release events. It's not too late to work on website and texts, right?
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">17:10:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> doing 11.4 marketing in april, with a launch date at 18th March ?
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">17:10:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> I would guess psankar would not want the meeting to be about 11.4 release hehe
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">17:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> just a wild guess ;-)
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">17:11:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, yes. I want it to be a marketing meeting not just for 11.4 release :-) (as I mentioned in the mail)
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">17:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> ah never mind. I didnt send that mail.
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">17:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> ok and agreed it shouldn't just be about teh 11.4 release
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">17:11:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> the problem is, u saw my poster u saw there are the main features also on, so that stuff is needed before and when u say that hackfest is for it the most say after that it can done on the hackfest
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">17:11:38 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">understand why I'm lost in paradise :-)</span>
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">17:11:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> good point, yes
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">17:12:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> I like the idea to do a hackfest, but let us make ther some more useful
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">17:12:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> we could finish the 3-4 main improvements before that for poster, then write a feature guide with the rest until, at and after the meeting?
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">17:12:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the thing is, if it turns out we're ahead of the game by the time February omes, then we can use the time to focus on other marketing stuff we need to do.
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">17:12:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> But if we're falling behind by Feb, then those dates when we're locked down for 2 days is an excellent way to get back on track.
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">17:12:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> And we can't decide at the last minute to organize a face to face hackfest.  Hackfest planning does take time.
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">17:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> u need a program to get the money?
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">17:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> guys and girls. I am just suggesting to try and write something like this feature guide: http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.4/guide.php now that needs a LOT of work, but it's not bad to do. We prepare the items beforehand, then at the meeting we finish it. Would take say 1-2 days of the meeting, then we feel good because we finished something. Then we can focus on the other things (including drinking Old Toad beer)
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">17:13:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> What's the expiration date on Old Toad beer?
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">17:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> can you PLEASE not think about beer but stay ontopic ;-)
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">17:14:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">17:14:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> you stinker!  :-)
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">17:14:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and yes, the old toad has to be drunk some time soon
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">17:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">17:14:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> can u give me an answer?
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">17:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> programm - as in a plan of what to do, or as in - I have to plan my marketing expenses? 1st no, 2nd yes
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">17:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> I have money reserved for specific periods, if I don't spend it I lose it
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">17:15:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ...
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">17:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> CarlosRibeiro,   as you said you were interested in attending  please add your information to the wiki page
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">17:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> count on us, you will not have anymore money :-)
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">17:15:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> how would be to work on general marketing material, a lot of work to do there and I would like to have some stuff available until flisol is
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">17:15:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> hehe
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">17:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  ok no problem after our meeting I go to wiki page
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">17:16:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> but I should add, that you will get in return real thing to show
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">17:16:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> sounds good, again, we could use one or two days for feature guide, then one-two days for other things. we need those materials, absolutely, so that would be high on the agenda as far as I'm concerned
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">17:16:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> love hearing that tigerfoot   :)
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">17:17:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> what I have in mind when I say create marketing material is really work for 4 days
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">17:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> yes, that's also why I want to try and focus on things we can do relatively easy. A feature guide and writing marketing materials like gnokii suggested is hard work, but it's something that gives almost guaranteed results. so it makes it all worth it
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">17:17:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> guys, you do know there's a section on that page for proposed agenda?   The more you put in what should be discussed/focused on, the better the broader picture we'll have for an effective hackfest
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">17:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> u know buttons, stcikers, broochures including the translations andd so on
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">17:17:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> well I think we should have several things at the meeting to do, not just one. Still, we could have a week long meeting. Or a weekend. Or a few weekdays. Whatever you guys want (and what works with my budget)
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">17:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> oops... "guys and gals",  sorry izabelvalverde   :-D
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">17:18:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> so we could do as much of those things as possible
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">17:18:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> u know me I always say better one thing with 100%
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">17:18:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> smart small, do it, redo smart small, do it, etc ... until you seen a big smile on gnokii face :-)
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">17:18:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> yeah, I know, and it's not a bad thing... Still I think if we have 4 days, doing 2 things as major focus should be OK, right?
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">17:19:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   ok so during hackfest  when we spin off into smaller groups, some of them will be just 2 people, some just 1 person.   We're not going to sit around a huge conference table all day talking
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">17:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> 2 days of hard work can get a lot done
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">17:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> we could also split up in two teams: one team works 4 days on marketing materials, the other team works 4 days on a feature guide and the release announcement. We have many ways of doing this!
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">17:19:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> jospoortvliet indeed
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">17:19:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> when is it planned ?
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">17:19:45 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">subscribe to hard &amp; work &amp; 2 days :-)</span>
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">17:19:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   we're hoping to do this right before or after FOSDEm
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">17:19:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> for FOSDEM
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">17:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> we need to plan it but should be somewhere around FOSDEM
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">17:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> in brussels?
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">17:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> before or after, but close
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">17:20:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> 3 and 4 february in BLX
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">17:20:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   no not that one.... the other FOSDEM  ;-D
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">17:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> you already have a place to do it?
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">17:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> coz...
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">17:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> probably in nuremberg (we have a office there &amp; some ppl to help organize it) but if you want to help organize it in Brussels (I doubt you have time hehe) that would be great
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">17:20:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> again, all options are still open
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">17:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> no chance that I can help organize it in brussels
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">17:21:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> this is a proposal - and I offered money and some ideas on what we could do but I dont' want to dicate it :D
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">17:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> we first need to know who is interested in going  so we can figure out how to allocate
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">17:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> ok ;-)
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">17:21:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> indeed

<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">17:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> better to keep all lizards grouped in the same hotel, and ask for a room there in BLX !

<a name="l-508"></a><span class="tm">17:22:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> that's an option

<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">17:23:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> *but* it is going to be pretty difficult to have everyone in the same hotel, and in a hotel that has conf rooms

<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">17:23:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> that's why nuremberg is good, we have the office as conf room and a hotel very close by. also, the local ppl can organize the hotel stuff and the conf room stuff so we don't have to worry
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">17:23:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> yes, but you won't be able to combine it with fosdem then ;)
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">17:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> no I wouldn't want to do it at the SAME time for sure
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">17:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> before or after would be nice however so ppl can combine it
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">17:24:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no I think yaloki  meant days before/after
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">17:24:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> and go to FOSDEM after the meeting

<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">17:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> to sleep away their hangover :D
<a name="l-522"></a><span class="tm">17:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> and you go after that to BXL ( need to be there before friday 5th 20h00 for freebeer event )
<a name="l-523"></a><span class="tm">17:24:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hehe
<a name="l-524"></a><span class="tm">17:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> travel to NUE for 2 days and then travel to BXL ?

<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">17:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> blx is brussel ( in aviation terms )
<a name="l-535"></a><span class="tm">17:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> it's "Bruxelles", hence the BXL ;)
<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">17:25:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   why does Belgium misspell Brussels?  :-)
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">17:25:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> and jospoortvliet is the horse before the car from NUE to BXL?
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">17:25:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> bxl ( damn keyboard )
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">17:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> :)
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">17:25:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> yeah so that's not very useful for me from NL, but if you come from USA it is not a big issue to travel to BXL from NUE :D
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">17:25:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> certainly
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">17:26:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> hence still synergy...
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">17:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> nevertheless, the option of doing it in a hotel in brussels would be even better
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">17:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   actually BXL would be a dream  as there's direct flights from US  unlike dreaded NUE which requires multi-flights  :-D
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">17:26:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> yup. we would need a local ground team to help organize the hotel and we need to find a conf room place
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">17:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> but more expensive
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">17:26:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> also costs are a factor!
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">17:26:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> but as said, also partly due to fosdem, it's not easy to find hotels, already now
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">17:26:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> exactly
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">17:26:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> nah, not really
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">17:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> so from that side would be NUE or CLT better
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">17:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> well NUE has a hostel close to the office, it is apparently cheap yet good
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">17:27:26 </span><span class="nka">* psankar</span> <span class="ac">remembers SuSE has some deal with the Euro hotel in Nuremberg for cheap rates and suggest NUE, also close to other people like AJ, coolo etc.</span>
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">17:27:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> again...  determining the feasibility of this depends greatly on people signing up, so let's get that going and if enthusiastic enough, we'll actually have a better idea very soon what the best options are
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">17:27:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> the euro hotel, yes (they have a new name now), it's very nice and 10 minutes by foot from the office
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">17:27:32 </span><span class="nka">* tigerfoot</span> <span class="ac">hand up .. jospoortvliet give me a affordable budget, for conf + rooms, suseROCKs note that as task for me , I will ask</span>
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">17:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> I'll be exploring all costs to get a base
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">17:27:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> actually no, euro hotel is expensive. a hoStel :D
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">17:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> jospoortvliet, if it is Euro you are referring to, I would say it is not just good, it is EXCELLENT ;-)
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">17:27:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">psankar:</span> AJ is otu for some time, and the arrangement isnt so cheap
<a name="l-561"></a><span class="tm">17:27:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> no, it *is* the eurohotel ;)
<a name="l-562"></a><span class="tm">17:28:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> jospoortvliet also has an organized group to help in NUE
<a name="l-563"></a><span class="tm">17:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> gnokii, yep. but we can pull him for one day ;-)
<a name="l-564"></a><span class="tm">17:28:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> well anyway, the hotel costs are &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; travel
<a name="l-565"></a><span class="tm">17:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> agreed.
<a name="l-566"></a><span class="tm">17:28:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> don't undersestimate hotel costs
<a name="l-567"></a><span class="tm">17:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (and typically cheaper to fly to brussels ;))
<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">17:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> quite a few peeps just come by train
<a name="l-569"></a><span class="tm">17:28:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> not that expensive
<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">17:28:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;psankar&gt;</span> for me for osc09, it was as high as my annual salary ;-)
<a name="l-571"></a><span class="tm">17:28:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,    conf + rooms budget will depend on who's going as well.   If we have many distant travelers, that impacts whether we rent a hotel + conf room or go to NUE and use their facilities for free
<a name="l-572"></a><span class="tm">17:29:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> can I send u from time to time hotel bills?
<a name="l-573"></a><span class="tm">17:29:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> ok so first we need to know who wants to go
<a name="l-574"></a><span class="tm">17:29:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> send them to jospoortvliet
<a name="l-575"></a><span class="tm">17:29:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then when they can go
<a name="l-576"></a><span class="tm">17:29:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> then pick a place

<a name="l-583"></a><span class="tm">17:30:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> right. Without know who wishes to be there the place discussion is not relevant
<a name="l-584"></a><span class="tm">17:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> we add a col for the location ?
<a name="l-585"></a><span class="tm">17:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Thank you CarlosRibeiro
<a name="l-586"></a><span class="tm">17:30:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> the place is from interest for some to go or not to go
<a name="l-587"></a><span class="tm">17:31:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> oh, I don't know whether it's really realistic in the first place
<a name="l-588"></a><span class="tm">17:31:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> btw the dates - we could add 2 days before as option
<a name="l-589"></a><span class="tm">17:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> too spread out, the travel costs are prohibitively high
<a name="l-590"></a><span class="tm">17:31:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> +1
<a name="l-591"></a><span class="tm">17:31:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span>  I believe ppl must be interest in help the project not about where is the place
<a name="l-592"></a><span class="tm">17:31:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> and, also
<a name="l-593"></a><span class="tm">17:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> say it's in NUE
<a name="l-594"></a><span class="tm">17:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> tigerfoot,   I think adding location column would make things more complex.    What I plan to do is once I see where everyone is from, look at reasonable central locations and costs  and then we can all agree where we actually want to go
<a name="l-595"></a><span class="tm">17:32:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> jospoortvliet,   sure
<a name="l-596"></a><span class="tm">17:32:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> then everyone from brazil, greece, ... can't attend
<a name="l-597"></a><span class="tm">17:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">CarlosRibeiro:</span> look I spent the whole year a lot of money in travel costs, I would can do more but I dont have the money for it
<a name="l-598"></a><span class="tm">17:32:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> then, personally, I'd even think that a face to face meeting with half the actively involved people (at most) is even counterproductive
<a name="l-599"></a><span class="tm">17:32:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   the budget Jos is putting aside is putting those long distances into consideration
<a name="l-600"></a><span class="tm">17:32:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> (because the other half or more won't be there and will miss the whole discussion)

<a name="l-602"></a><span class="tm">17:33:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> it is our goal to have as many relevant people there.  not just who's the cheapest to get there
<a name="l-603"></a><span class="tm">17:33:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> it's about getting work done as much as discussing ;-)

<a name="l-610"></a><span class="tm">17:34:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jospoortvliet:</span> sure u can found me a lot, I do then three times event more as before
<a name="l-611"></a><span class="tm">17:34:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   you'd have to ask jos that.  I'm not the one who owns that budget and can't answer for it
<a name="l-612"></a><span class="tm">17:34:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> lupinstein,   this is for a proposed hackfest in February  http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:11.4_Marketing_Hackfest
<a name="l-613"></a><span class="tm">17:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> just make sure you don't spend half the time redefining the strategy :)

<a name="l-616"></a><span class="tm">17:35:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yaloki,   lol   no,  we're hoping to base our work on the strategy statement  :-)
<a name="l-617"></a><span class="tm">17:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> because there are quite a few who haven't gotten the message, apparently

<a name="l-619"></a><span class="tm">17:36:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> well, no, the strategy is cool, but there are quite a few people who are putting their top priority on "end users" and "newbie friendly"
<a name="l-620"></a><span class="tm">17:36:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> ah, cool.
<a name="l-621"></a><span class="tm">17:36:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> which is exactly what we do _not_ want to do
<a name="l-622"></a><span class="tm">17:36:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> lupinstein is even running for board on that premise, if I'm not mistaken
<a name="l-623"></a><span class="tm">17:36:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> the budget - I don't want to discuss it beforehand but rest assured that I'll try to get as much ppl there, even if it is expensive. Obviously I don't have money to fly in 20 ppl from Brazil and india and USA...
<a name="l-624"></a><span class="tm">17:37:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tigerfoot&gt;</span> my vision is like what jospoortvliet present with the kde4.4 announcement, just explaining not so techi sland, what people can found in our product
<a name="l-625"></a><span class="tm">17:37:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;izabelvalverde&gt;</span> jospoortvliet some day will have :D
<a name="l-626"></a><span class="tm">17:37:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">izabelvalverde:</span> for sure
<a name="l-627"></a><span class="tm">17:38:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;yaloki&gt;</span> unless we become as successful as the mozilla foundation, we won't..
<a name="l-628"></a><span class="tm">17:38:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tigerfoot:</span> that would be awesome, yes. And combined with writing and making marketing materials, we have enough to do. Of course there will be other planning and discussing etc and fun too. But I'd like to make sure we have some things we can surely finish because that way we have a guaranteed success.
<a name="l-629"></a><span class="tm">17:38:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">yaloki:</span> I am running to help out be more of leader.
<a name="l-630"></a><span class="tm">17:38:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> yaloki: let's please not discuss that here and now
<a name="l-631"></a><span class="tm">17:39:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok I think we can end the discussion on the hackfest and fine-tuning the direction of it can be done on the mailing list.
<a name="l-632"></a><span class="tm">17:39:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> We all agree?
<a name="l-633"></a><span class="tm">17:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> agreed. so anyone who is willing and able to come, just put in your name. We can then see what location would be best, how much money it costs and what exactly we do there.
<a name="l-634"></a><span class="tm">17:39:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jospoortvliet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii:</span> I added your idea on marketing materials work
