<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:27:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;manugupt1&gt;</span> But yes people can hold it at different places
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:27:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> i dont think so
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:27:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> making a install fest its not that hard

<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> let me explain my experience about
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:27:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> @AJaeger exactly my point
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iosifidis&gt;</span> Personally I planned to make a speech on October about 11.3 and show how they can install it.
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:27:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> I agree, we are doing good with "Launch Parties", but are dropping the ball between releases.
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> You're right, we're going into details but need the big picture first
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:28:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> the last year i organize a install fest using my contacts to get a room, and even pizza
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:28:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> &amp; suseROCKs I DONT AGREE WITH THAT
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:28:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> all that i do its put some machines with demostration
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> and call for people with some papers pasted on walls
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">15:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> For example, you said in last topic that more interaction was needed.  Let's focus now how to improve that interaction.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">15:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> "if you wanna start with linux this is your chance"
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">15:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ok, then we decided the we need to another Ambassadors meeting for keep the events topics moving on
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">15:28:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> and pluf, i make an install fest
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">15:29:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   You disagree with discussing the big picture?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">15:29:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> no I disagree with "[17:34] &lt;lupinstein&gt; suseROCKs: I agree, we are doing good with "Launch Parties"
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">15:30:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> gnokii everyone has diff. timelines
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">15:30:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii,   Well I didn't say anything about how we are doing with launch parties.  I am only trying to keep this meeting on topic with the program itself.
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">15:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> please elaborate gnokii

<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">15:31:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes CarlosRibeiro   Please return to the discussion about interaction.  This is very important for us
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">15:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> ok, back to the interaction....
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">15:31:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> how do you guys believe we can improve our interactions?
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">15:31:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> As well as what gnokii said: Ambassadors are individuals - not yet a "we".  It's great to have this meeting to form a "we" (team) but how to continue?
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">15:32:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> Is the ML not sufficient?
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">15:32:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> the ML started just a few days ago.  :-)
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">15:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> I mean someone sees a mail, he can help, he replies.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">15:32:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> is it not that simple?
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">15:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span>  you are right again, the ML had began few days ago as a real prove that we are looking for improve more interaction
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">15:33:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> kknundy,   The question really is, are you getting the right kind of support from openSUSE?   (e.g., are you getting proper information, updates, coordination, etc.?)
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">15:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> and about dedicated IRC chanell. It's really necessary?
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">15:33:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> oooh ooh
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">15:34:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> What frustrations have you all had in the past about Ambassador program?
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">15:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> Information channels are pretty straightforward.
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">15:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> Not so with material and tech support \/guidance
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">15:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> Well I know that on 11.2 DVD, I had issues because we didn't have enough for the events I when too.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">15:34:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;HeliosReds&gt;</span> The point is, many Ambassadors make install festa, attend/organeze local events... but there are only few reports about them.
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">15:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> <span class="hi">HeliosReds:</span> +1
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">15:34:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">HeliosReds:</span> ++++++
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">15:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sakana&gt;</span> +1 HeliosReds
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">15:34:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">HeliosReds:</span>  and this is the point.
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">15:35:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> So one thing that would be nice is more DVD for events.
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">15:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> Yes, maybe we should report more HeliosRed
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">15:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> thats what i mean when i say "improve the values of the ambassador program"
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">15:35:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lupinstein&gt;</span> +1 HeliosReds
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">15:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> does not matter if Ambassadors do a event for 2, 3, 50 or more audience
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">15:35:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sakana&gt;</span> I think we need to chat with the others  --------- for example skype or IM
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">15:35:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lupinstein:</span> I hope we do better with 11.3, if you need media, just mail me (aj at opensuse dot org)
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">15:35:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> we need to track it, share experiences, take pictures and publish. or not?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:35:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alexbariv&gt;</span> the idea its to call for events and make buzz around
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">15:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> If an Ambassador asks for more material DVDs, maybe it could be asked why
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">15:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,   Do we have a #notes feature or someting with meetbot or should we just use #action to record these notes?
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:36:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> If the Why is justified, it should be based on requirement
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:36:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> use #action or #info
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:36:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;CarlosRibeiro&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sakana:</span>  good point about skype, IM....
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sakana:</span> it isnt important to use IRC or Skype or Jabber I would be lucky all ambassadors have a EMail address what is functional

<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">15:42:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kknundy&gt;</span> Blog should do. But we could have an Ambassador planet.

<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:42:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;iosifidis&gt;</span> yes. must have template for report.
