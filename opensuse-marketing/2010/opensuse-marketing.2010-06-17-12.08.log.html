<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">12:11:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Request for Participation (papers) for the conference
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">12:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> a) the media reads news.o.o
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">12:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> You had the AI to let media know about it and get it published in some calendars
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">12:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> b) I had a conversation with LinuxNewMedia at LinuxTag, they want to become Media Partner for the conference
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">12:12:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> btw. do we speak on www.opensuse.org about the conference yet?
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">12:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and yes, I'll contact other media as well
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">12:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> is  LinuxNewMedia 's reach good ?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">12:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> (Curious) .
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">12:13:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> in Germany way more then good
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">12:13:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> let's make sure we are published in LWN's community calendar and umm I think its called calendardulibre is another one?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">12:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I'd say in Europe good
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">12:13:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and they distribute their magazines word wide
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">12:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> michl, cool :-) .
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">12:13:47 </span><span class="nka">* suseROCKs</span> <span class="ac">high-fives michl  for engaging LinuxNewMedia</span>
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">12:13:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and have now for 2 years or so an office in NA to push their magazines there as well
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">12:14:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Guess I better buy their magazine then  :-)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">12:14:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> and post a report :)
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">12:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> AJaeger,  I think if the conf committee feels their conf page is ready, we should definitely put a banner or something on www. to point people to it.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">12:15:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   What do we need to do to work with LNM?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">12:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Could we get free adspace for the oonference in their magazines?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">12:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> exchange emails, feed them with content
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">12:16:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> so they can write about the conference
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">12:16:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> yes
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">12:17:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so a) we need to make sure Klass feeds us information regularly about conference updates, and b) we need someone to design adspace material to give to LMN
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">12:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> This is good.  I'm glad to hear all this.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">12:17:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> so now I am her but it isnt 12 UTC
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">12:18:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> It isn't?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">12:18:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> michl "the media" reads not all news.o.o its funny Hilzinger doesnt
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">12:19:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> second LNM did wrote in LC and is mostly that LM print it online too, and they did
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">12:20:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_ has a point.  We can't completely rely on news.o.o.  We should draft up a press release to send to media announcing the RFP
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">12:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> did I say that I love abbrevations?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">12:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> we shouldn't and don't rely on news.o.o
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">12:21:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> michl LC == Linux-community.de, LNM == Linux New Media
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">12:22:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> LM == Linux Magazin
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">12:22:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> yes, we need to reach out to multipliers of any kind directly
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">12:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> (which means we need to start developing our own database of multipliers)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">12:23:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">suseROCKs:</span> hah, you said the bad word - database
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">12:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok   paper and pen.   Better?  :-D
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">12:23:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> means multipliers journalists?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">12:23:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> in michl's dream there is a database which is accesible for a defined group of people to add contacts
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">12:23:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> multipliers = journalists and anyone else who has ability to spread the word
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">12:24:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> from interested users, to contact persons at events/universities etc, key people in our community to press people

<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">12:33:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> the account openSUSECOnf

<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">12:33:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> gnokii_, do you handle openSUSEConf account ?
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">12:33:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> just some grammar advice,   if its not a person, you should call it "it"  if you call it him or her, it gets confusing.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">12:34:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> @openSUSE will tweet tomorrow: "Follow @openSUSEconf  to keep updated about the openSUSE Conference #FF  ^AJ"

<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">12:36:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AJaeger&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#followfriday </span><span class="cmdline">?</span>
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">12:36:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> I have no more ideas right now as fill the conference in every calendar u find
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">12:37:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> gnokii_,   Tell you what.  I have a small window of time later today that I might be able to do the linkedin event
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">12:37:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> if I do that, do you want to send email to the ML with your listed items above?  So more people are aware to spread the word?
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">12:39:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> next thing we need before the call ends a really good keynotspeaker so that we have an new press message
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">12:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> is that for us to work on or is that something for the conference committee to work on?
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">12:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I'd say anyone with an idea should speak up
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">12:40:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> yes but is it a marketing team task specifically is all I'm asking.  i don't want any toe-stepping here.  :-)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">12:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> I know Klaas has some ideas but he's on vacation this and the following week
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">12:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> who do we focus ? (inside Novell or outside Novell)
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">12:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> or openSUSE ?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">12:41:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> SJ,  most likely outside
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">12:41:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> okay !.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">12:41:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> the program committee should know it and at the end I'd say they should do the contact and assemble it to the conference where it fits
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">12:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> no there's no one in openSUSE right now that can be a major attractor to the world for a keynote speaker  :-)
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">12:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">12:42:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> michl,   perfect, that's what I wanted to clear up.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">12:42:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> one can ask the LM's or LNM's to provide some contacts ? (building some good relationships :) )
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">12:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> michl +1 for speak up
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">12:43:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> contact person from LM's or LNM's *
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">12:43:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> SJ,  no  that makes us look needy
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">12:43:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> ohk .
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">12:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> There's plenty of good well known people in the FOSS community we can think of without needing LNM's help
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">12:44:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> or even Bill Gates.  :-D
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">12:44:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SJ&gt;</span> great :-)
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">12:44:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> or James Utzschneider
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">12:44:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> ok so the only conference wiki page we have is the RFP one,  we don't have a general conference page yet?
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">12:44:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gnokii_&gt;</span> michl u talked with that M$ guy utzschneider?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">12:44:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gnokii_:</span> no, just visited the key note
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">12:45:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> and see a) he's a good talker and b) there are relations between his department and the Linux Community
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">12:45:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;michl&gt;</span> FYI - james is heading the open source department at Microsoft
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">12:46:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;suseROCKs&gt;</span> Do we want a banner yet on www.opensuse.org?  We have no general conference page yet (afaict)
