<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:01:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> about 12.2 and what coming out? All this stuff needs to be done .
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">19:01:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> So
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:02:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what are your thoughts?
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> actually I gouess we should wait for the Release notes in order to discuss that
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:02:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> I wrote in my twitter @duddatech, and refer to @openSUSE.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:03:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what we usually do is use all sociall media to spread the word to the world
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:03:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Eduaraujo:</span>  yeap that is the way
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also use Facebook, linkedin G+ or whatever else you have
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I've already started using my blog to write guides on topics I think people might find important for 12.2 - like my article on battery life. I plan on doing more of that and my usual on twitter and now G+
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:04:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> a nice thing to do is use your local communities profile in all that
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:05:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> I'll start a blog to share the openSUSE news.
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> like we in Greece use openSUSE-el
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:05:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also blogging is necessary
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> for now we can say things like openSUSE 12.2 is comming
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:05:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and other similar stuff
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> yep.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> working the Beta or the RC edition would help you to expose some of the new features
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:06:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> generally what we need to make as ambassadors is make a lot of noise around about it
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:07:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also a nice thing to do is speak to your local community people and have them help you with all that
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> posters can be helpful too.
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> both in English but also in your native langouage too since not everybody speaks English
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:08:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I believe we will have posters but this will be after the release
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:09:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ask for promo material and spread it around
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:09:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> think outside the box
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:09:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is really important
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:09:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> a non-official version... svg of 12.1 with some changes.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I believe we have 12.2 artwork
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span> ?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:10:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> do we?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:10:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> there is a ton of artwork in the github repo, let me just get the URL
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:10:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> github.com/openSUSE/branding
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:10:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> sorry for that guys but I am still a bit hangovered from last night and my RAM is really slow and limited :D
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:11:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span>  any possible questions?
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> we dont have much derivative stuff yet, we need to update the slides and other promotional materials in https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork to make use of the 12.2 branding
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:11:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> that's something I have on my radar for the gap between RC2 and release
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:11:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> posters create a nice visual effect...
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:11:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> oh Ilmehtar when slides will be available you think?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:11:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I know that's al ittle later than I'd like but I'm splitting my time (much more limited than last release) between bug testing, gnome stuff, and this stuff :)
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:12:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we can use the backround of 12.2 for posters
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I might try and get the slides done tomorrow though
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> no, maybe a can ask rodger to get access to openSUSE page on g+
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> it's a great background to layer stuff ontop, it's very 'plain' compared to our 12.1 background though
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I would incourage you to make local pages of openSUSE in G+
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> also a possibillity
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:13:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that way you may atract more people into it
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it work for us
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and AFAIK it work for the Spanish too
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also speaking your native langouage is better for most local users
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:15:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anything else around Social media?
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:15:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> not from my side
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> Youtube channel would be fine...
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:16:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:16:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> local channels...
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:16:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> who'd make the videos for it?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> you can use youtube channel
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:16:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:16:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> video content isn't exactly something we've ever seen much of from our community
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:16:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> the ambassadors
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:17:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> someone who is great at video editing, is an artist and he is British? :D
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> record the videos...
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well we can be seen from now on
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:17:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> saying what is cool about openSUSE...
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we can always make a fresh start
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:18:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Eduaraujo:</span> +1
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so who wants to try and make a promo video for 12.2?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> maybe more than one person
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:19:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> who is willing to take that task?
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:19:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> today, even cell phones shoot video in a good resolution...
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:19:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well editing is the problem here as I see it
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:20:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> warlordfff, you should contact mfoxdogg, he created a video on blender for intros for the distro videos. Maybe he can take it further
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:20:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> but a camcorder is better
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:20:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I have some ideas but honestly, I have a lot on my plate
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:20:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> It is a problem.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:20:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span>  can you send me an email with his contact and some more details?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:20:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> phew, good thing I'm not an artist and no good at video editin
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> (forgive the lag in my replies - watching the Olympic opening ceremony)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:20:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tux93&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> share your ideas, maybe someone can grab them
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:21:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tux93:</span>  you are right
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:21:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> he will be available in a couple of hours at #opensuse-artwork
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:21:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> also victorhck did some trials with blender as well
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:21:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span>  my mind is mushed up and what I don't see in e-mail I loose it :s
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:22:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so ideas
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:22:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> the youtube idea would make A LOT of noise
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok, I will mention it to him
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:23:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> but editing is a problem
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:23:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I don't know his email, that's why
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:23:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> i was thinking in making something where many ambassadors and developers will speak in fron of the cammera giving details for the new edition and at the same time showing that to the video
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:23:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:24:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span> ok in that case I will try to be later in opensuse-artwork and talk with him, also we could continue that video thing to tha mailing list

<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">20:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so nothing to tell about this actually

<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">20:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we have the money and we really want to spent it all
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">20:26:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> travel support applications deadline expired last week.
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">20:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> my biggest issue with the travel fund is that for events like the Summit, I worry that the process started too late, and is giving its answers so late that prices are going to be higher than originally quoted by the ambassadors - how will the fund deal with it if it an ambassador finds that they cant afford a significantly higher price because airfairs and accomodtion have increased during the del
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">20:26:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> ay?
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">20:27:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait please to finish those I would like to say and i will answer everything
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">20:27:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">20:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> We want to give everyone the change to come
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">20:29:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but as it should be done, those who work and those who need the money should get them
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">20:29:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> trust me, this is not easy
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">20:29:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but me and Izabel are really trying to make things right
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">20:29:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so now hit me
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">20:29:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">20:30:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span>  you might are right but the thing is to see what we can do from now on with this
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">20:31:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I know it isn't easy buddy, I'm not suggesting it is, I'm purely raising an issue that could be a major point of concern..how are you going to deal with it if/when ambassadors find it's going to cost them more than they originally quoted for?
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">20:31:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I know in my case I'm going to find it very difficult, especially at this brutally short notice, to find extra money to get myself to the summit
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">20:31:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I know that, I also have a problem with it
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">20:32:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> warlordfff, it's just a matter of requesting them via the mailing list
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">20:32:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span>  yeap but if we reach the limit of the money we must share the money the right way
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">20:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> now I guess we will reply soon to the people who asked money for the Summit
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">20:33:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> I think anditosan might be talking about your artwork requests :)
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">20:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">20:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> if I dont get a reply by the 30th, then I'm very stuck, because I am *required* to confirm whether I'm going or not by the 1st, because I'm meant to be a speaker
<a name="l-337"></a><span class="tm">20:34:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> yeap
<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">20:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> yes sorry, I was off for a minute
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">20:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> if it's about money matters, please talk to Jos
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">20:34:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I thing that this will be setled in the weekend but honestly I cannot promise anything
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">20:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">anditosan:</span>  the reason that the TST was made was not to ask Jos
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">20:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-343"></a><span class="tm">20:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also Jos is off those days
<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">20:35:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">20:35:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> very dissapointing - what is the point of the programme if it takes so long we cant practically book travel and accomodation anyhow? and ends up causing knock on effects that prevent the smooth planning of the event itself? I'm not going to be popular if I say 'I dunno' if I can attend my own sessio nor not ;-)
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">20:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this only happened in Summit
<a name="l-347"></a><span class="tm">20:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and again, we are trying and mistakes are done
<a name="l-348"></a><span class="tm">20:37:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> for oSC it will be better I think
<a name="l-349"></a><span class="tm">20:37:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I don't think I'll be comfortably relying on it :-;
<a name="l-350"></a><span class="tm">20:37:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> :-/
<a name="l-351"></a><span class="tm">20:38:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I know dude and trust me that I totaly get you but I really cannot do nothing
<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">20:38:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> I see
<a name="l-353"></a><span class="tm">20:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">warlordfff:</span> that's fine, if you can't, who can?
<a name="l-354"></a><span class="tm">20:39:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what I meant is that you have to wait for an answer
<a name="l-355"></a><span class="tm">20:39:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> let's send it up the project ml
<a name="l-356"></a><span class="tm">20:39:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait a minute please
<a name="l-357"></a><span class="tm">20:39:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;anditosan&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-358"></a><span class="tm">20:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we will send replies on time
<a name="l-359"></a><span class="tm">20:40:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it is not 30th of July yet
<a name="l-360"></a><span class="tm">20:40:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so why the panic?
<a name="l-361"></a><span class="tm">20:41:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that was the plan from the beggining
<a name="l-362"></a><span class="tm">20:41:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> my point is, the 30th of July, is still too short a time for an event that is going to have expensive travel like Summit
<a name="l-363"></a><span class="tm">20:41:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I get Ilmehtar but that does not mean anything, when you guys asked for sponsorship you read the scedule
<a name="l-364"></a><span class="tm">20:42:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> the price I quoted for hotel and flight back when I first requested was 10% less than when I was allowed to quote again on the 20th of July, and now it's going to be the 30th before I get an answer and can start booking things
<a name="l-365"></a><span class="tm">20:42:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well it is still 1 and a 1/2 month earlier
<a name="l-366"></a><span class="tm">20:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> the plan is the team will sponser 80%..will they sponser 80% of what I quoted, or 80% of what it actually costs me because the prices steadily go up the closer you get to travel dates?
<a name="l-367"></a><span class="tm">20:43:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and we made that announcement a month a go
<a name="l-368"></a><span class="tm">20:43:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> because in the case of the summit, we're not talking about a few quid, but potentially several hundred pounds more that I'll ahve to find
<a name="l-369"></a><span class="tm">20:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> why didn't you reacted back then?
<a name="l-370"></a><span class="tm">20:43:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> the anouncement was made by Jos at 26/6
<a name="l-371"></a><span class="tm">20:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> Because I didn't realise quite how much and how aggressively Flights and hotel prices would increase within 8 weeks
<a name="l-372"></a><span class="tm">20:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> and that's my point
<a name="l-373"></a><span class="tm">20:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> there is a fatal flaw in the current procedure
<a name="l-374"></a><span class="tm">20:44:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well there in nothing I can do for that
<a name="l-375"></a><span class="tm">20:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> we're not allowed to book until we get a yes/no from the team
<a name="l-376"></a><span class="tm">20:44:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-377"></a><span class="tm">20:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> but once we do yet a yes/no, will the Ambassador be expected to cover the additional costs that have been incurred due to the length the process took?
<a name="l-378"></a><span class="tm">20:44:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> you are right
<a name="l-379"></a><span class="tm">20:44:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> next time we will try to make it better
<a name="l-380"></a><span class="tm">20:45:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but for now, thats it
<a name="l-381"></a><span class="tm">20:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> or will the sponsership programme be able to cover the increased costs, not the costs originally quoted by the ambassador?
<a name="l-382"></a><span class="tm">20:45:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> nop
<a name="l-383"></a><span class="tm">20:45:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that is written in the TSP
<a name="l-384"></a><span class="tm">20:45:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> again
<a name="l-385"></a><span class="tm">20:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> show me where
<a name="l-386"></a><span class="tm">20:45:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> you did not knew it, how could we know it?
<a name="l-387"></a><span class="tm">20:46:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait please
<a name="l-388"></a><span class="tm">20:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> my point is - the extra cost is caused by the delay, the schedule which the TSP is imposing
<a name="l-389"></a><span class="tm">20:46:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> lets say the process was a 1st-come, 1st served process, you'd get a much faster answer, and ambassadors would be able to book without having to shoulder MORE than 20% because of the increases in travel prices as events get closer
<a name="l-390"></a><span class="tm">20:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Remember!
<a name="l-391"></a><span class="tm">20:47:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> If your ticket or travel gets more expensive after an amount has been confirmed, the excess will not be reimbursed
<a name="l-392"></a><span class="tm">20:47:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is it
<a name="l-393"></a><span class="tm">20:47:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> again
<a name="l-394"></a><span class="tm">20:48:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> then I think the TSP programme needs to be reworked to give much faster answers
<a name="l-395"></a><span class="tm">20:48:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> there was not a single delay
<a name="l-396"></a><span class="tm">20:48:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> the schedule is a 'delay'..you had ambassdors (me) ready to book weeks before I was 'allowed' to even put in my request
<a name="l-397"></a><span class="tm">20:48:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> you all knew when you will get an answer
<a name="l-398"></a><span class="tm">20:48:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> and I'm still left hanging, not knowing if I can go, and now not knowing if I can even afford to go
<a name="l-399"></a><span class="tm">20:48:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> again you all knew when you will get an answer
<a name="l-400"></a><span class="tm">20:49:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> as I see flight and accomodtion get higher and higher..
<a name="l-401"></a><span class="tm">20:49:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> that doesn't change the fact that it would be MUCh cheaper for me, as an ambassador, if I could get an answer much faster
<a name="l-402"></a><span class="tm">20:49:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> you are maybe right that this might be a bit late but this was the way it was planned and nobody said anthing before
<a name="l-403"></a><span class="tm">20:50:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I still don't get where we dissagree
<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">20:50:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> well I sure did..I was sending emails asking about the process back in May and either got no reply or got told I had to wait
<a name="l-405"></a><span class="tm">20:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> we disagree where you seem to think it's a good idea to make ambassadors wait for a decision, which increases the cost to the ambassador (who has to field the excess)
<a name="l-406"></a><span class="tm">20:51:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-407"></a><span class="tm">20:51:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> where as I feel that the process should be reworked to give a much faster answer to those ambassadors who want to book earlier, and therefore save themselves *and the project* more money
<a name="l-408"></a><span class="tm">20:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> at start I said I understand that
<a name="l-409"></a><span class="tm">20:51:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and we will try to make it better
<a name="l-410"></a><span class="tm">20:52:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> unfortunatelly for now noone can do nothing
<a name="l-411"></a><span class="tm">20:52:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> if the project approved my sponsership back in may, it would have been 10% less of the projects money than it's going to if it accepts my request now for example
<a name="l-412"></a><span class="tm">20:52:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-413"></a><span class="tm">20:53:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so the one who send the request earlier would get sponsored and the others would not...
<a name="l-414"></a><span class="tm">20:53:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> is this even close to fair?
<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">20:53:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> is it fair to make ambassadors pay more because of enforced delays?
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">20:53:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we did it that way because we wanted to be fair to all, not to cause problems
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">20:54:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> yes, I do think it's fair to sponser those who proactive and commit to going earlier
<a name="l-418"></a><span class="tm">20:54:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> next time we will try to make it better
<a name="l-419"></a><span class="tm">20:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> did you know that there would be such an increase of prices?
<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">20:54:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> No
<a name="l-421"></a><span class="tm">20:54:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> it shows they're taking a proactive interest in the project, it saves the project money, and it saves them more money
<a name="l-422"></a><span class="tm">20:54:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> how could we know that?
<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">20:54:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> yes, I knew there would be some - travel prices ALWAYS get more expensive the closer you get to a travel date
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">20:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> no
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">20:54:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> wait
<a name="l-426"></a><span class="tm">20:55:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we want to give all the money
<a name="l-427"></a><span class="tm">20:55:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> why shouldn't we
<a name="l-428"></a><span class="tm">20:55:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> whats the point of giving all the money if ambassadors cant afford to pay the excess they're going to be forced to pay because they've had to wait for everyone else to put in their requests?
<a name="l-429"></a><span class="tm">20:55:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-430"></a><span class="tm">20:56:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-431"></a><span class="tm">20:56:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I think that you don't understand me
<a name="l-432"></a><span class="tm">20:56:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-433"></a><span class="tm">20:56:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> you think forcing proactive ambassadors to wait for the lazy ones to have an opportunity to put in their request so they can all be considered equally is 'fair'
<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">20:56:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what I can propose is since you did not get any answer yet, nobody did
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">20:56:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> send the new prices
<a name="l-436"></a><span class="tm">20:57:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> not only you
<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">20:57:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> all of you
<a name="l-438"></a><span class="tm">20:57:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> this is fair for all
<a name="l-439"></a><span class="tm">20:57:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok?
<a name="l-440"></a><span class="tm">20:57:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I am here to help
<a name="l-441"></a><span class="tm">20:57:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-442"></a><span class="tm">20:57:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I really am
<a name="l-443"></a><span class="tm">20:58:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it is not like I will use the money otherwise
<a name="l-444"></a><span class="tm">20:58:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> those money are for there
<a name="l-445"></a><span class="tm">20:58:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> any other issues? I really need to get going, I'm an hour late
<a name="l-446"></a><span class="tm">20:58:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> only
<a name="l-447"></a><span class="tm">20:58:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> it is you asking me
<a name="l-448"></a><span class="tm">20:58:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and please don't get mad
<a name="l-449"></a><span class="tm">20:58:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we really try to do our best here
<a name="l-450"></a><span class="tm">20:59:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I know, I'm just frustrated, I raised these concerns when I first heard of the TSP, and it's annoying to find myself stuck where I feared others could end up :)
<a name="l-451"></a><span class="tm">20:59:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> so this is the same for oSC
<a name="l-452"></a><span class="tm">21:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> if those who will apply see the prices raising just send us(on time) the new prices
<a name="l-453"></a><span class="tm">21:00:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I have an idea..
<a name="l-454"></a><span class="tm">21:00:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Ilmehtar:</span>  you are probably the only who has that problem since you are going there from Europe
<a name="l-455"></a><span class="tm">21:00:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> probably
<a name="l-456"></a><span class="tm">21:01:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> but hotels still cost a fair bit :-p
<a name="l-457"></a><span class="tm">21:01:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> send all the new prices
<a name="l-458"></a><span class="tm">21:01:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> not sure if you'll like it, but it's a comrpomise between the idea of first-come first served, and 'everyone wait until everyone has had a chance to request'
<a name="l-459"></a><span class="tm">21:01:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> but please do it today
<a name="l-460"></a><span class="tm">21:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'll try, but it's 10PM here and I REALLY need to get going
<a name="l-461"></a><span class="tm">21:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> :-p
<a name="l-462"></a><span class="tm">21:01:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> anyway, my idea before I really have to run
<a name="l-463"></a><span class="tm">21:01:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-464"></a><span class="tm">21:01:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I love you anyway dude :D
<a name="l-465"></a><span class="tm">21:02:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> why doesn't the TSP do some kind of 'banding' approach - 1st wave of requests considered on Date X (nice and early) second wave of requests considered on Date Y (mid way through the process) and the last wave of requests considered at the same kind of distance from the event as you're doing now?
<a name="l-466"></a><span class="tm">21:03:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-467"></a><span class="tm">21:03:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> yes, it does mean there is a chance that the last wave will miss out..but it should encorage ambassadors to proactivly work on getting themselves out to those events
<a name="l-468"></a><span class="tm">21:03:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> 10 days are ok and there is no actuall reason to make things more complicated
<a name="l-469"></a><span class="tm">21:03:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> also there is a ton of other things that you cannot predict in that
<a name="l-470"></a><span class="tm">21:04:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I do think the entire process of the TSP was started later than it should have been..like I said, I was ready in May, and I'm a slacker :-p
<a name="l-471"></a><span class="tm">21:04:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well not all people can make plans for 3-4-5 months after
<a name="l-472"></a><span class="tm">21:04:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and everybody should be able to file a request
<a name="l-473"></a><span class="tm">21:05:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I know, but should the ones who can make plans 5 months before be punished with higher prices ?
<a name="l-474"></a><span class="tm">21:05:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I'm paying more, the project is paying more, I dont see how that helps anyone, because it means theres less money to go around for others
<a name="l-475"></a><span class="tm">21:05:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well as I said I don't think that this is fair for everybody
<a name="l-476"></a><span class="tm">21:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> we could talk around that but we need a couple of hours
<a name="l-477"></a><span class="tm">21:06:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> thats why I suggest the banding approach..put aside a chunk of the money for the first round of requests, get them out of the way early, save money there, and then you know exactly how much you have left for everyone else who comes in later
<a name="l-478"></a><span class="tm">21:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what happens if the first wave is half of the money?
<a name="l-479"></a><span class="tm">21:07:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> do you give them half of the money or do you refuse reinbursment to people?
<a name="l-480"></a><span class="tm">21:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and what happens if noone will apply for the next 2 waves
<a name="l-481"></a><span class="tm">21:07:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> what would you say to the people you refused money?
<a name="l-482"></a><span class="tm">21:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> you dont make ith alf the money..you say.."Okay, we have 1000 for event X. Lets put 300 aside for the first wave" - you get the first wave of requests, and you accept as many of them as you can. If you spend the 300, then you tell the poor people who dont get in on the first wave "Dont worry, you'll get an answer later on"
<a name="l-483"></a><span class="tm">21:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> there is a simple problem to think
<a name="l-484"></a><span class="tm">21:08:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> mmm
<a name="l-485"></a><span class="tm">21:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> is not that simple
<a name="l-486"></a><span class="tm">21:08:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and you know it
<a name="l-487"></a><span class="tm">21:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> then you have 700 left, to spend on the later requesters and the ones you couldn't fit in the first wave
<a name="l-488"></a><span class="tm">21:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> why isn't it that simple?
<a name="l-489"></a><span class="tm">21:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> because there is also the matter of contribution
<a name="l-490"></a><span class="tm">21:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> because there is also the matter of previously sponsored
<a name="l-491"></a><span class="tm">21:09:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> and around 5-10 more reasons
<a name="l-492"></a><span class="tm">21:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> all things you'll know about when the first wave is being considered
<a name="l-493"></a><span class="tm">21:09:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> I dont see the problem there
<a name="l-494"></a><span class="tm">21:09:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well we disagree on that
<a name="l-495"></a><span class="tm">21:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I see
<a name="l-496"></a><span class="tm">21:10:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> and there's another issue here - this is a mess for our own event..the Summit - what if I was requested sponsorship to an externally hosted event?
<a name="l-497"></a><span class="tm">21:10:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> How bad would openSUSE look if I was, for example, having to tell FOSDEM "Sorry, I dont know if I can speak or not, because I dont know if I can afford to come or not, because my project haven't told me if I'm sponsored yet or not"?
<a name="l-498"></a><span class="tm">21:10:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> Summit and osc has nothing to do with other events
<a name="l-499"></a><span class="tm">21:10:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> seperate money
<a name="l-500"></a><span class="tm">21:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> so no way this would happen for another event?
<a name="l-501"></a><span class="tm">21:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> honestly?
<a name="l-502"></a><span class="tm">21:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> I don't know, all I know is that all of us in the TST we are trying to do our best for everyone
<a name="l-503"></a><span class="tm">21:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> well I've done my bit to point out an area that could do with improvement if we want to make sure we dont embarrass ourselves infront of other projects and events
<a name="l-504"></a><span class="tm">21:13:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Ilmehtar&gt;</span> now I really have to dash, I'll be around tomorrow
<a name="l-505"></a><span class="tm">21:13:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> osc and summit would be transmitted... for the guys that can't go
<a name="l-506"></a><span class="tm">21:13:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-507"></a><span class="tm">21:13:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Eduaraujo:</span>  I don't know

<a name="l-509"></a><span class="tm">21:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> Guys, I think we miss the point.
<a name="l-510"></a><span class="tm">21:13:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Eduaraujo&gt;</span> in a particular site...
<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">21:14:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> suseROCKs can answer you that about Summit Eduaraujo
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">21:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> If someone wants to join a conference, usually pays to attend it.
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">21:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> As visitor I mean.
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">21:14:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> If he wants wants to make a presentation (he has something to present) he applies for it.

<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">21:16:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> well diamond_gr just leave it there
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">21:16:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> If someone wants travelling sponsorship to present something, then it's his problem and not the organization that will provide the money
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">21:16:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;diamond_gr&gt;</span> That's what I think.
<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">21:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that is what I think also\
<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">21:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> anyway
<a name="l-521"></a><span class="tm">21:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;warlordfff&gt;</span> that is also what I do
