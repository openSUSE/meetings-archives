<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> yes kcall will basically be a thin UI around kde-telepathy
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:16:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;remur_030&gt;</span> so there is chance for a decent sip application coming? =)

<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">16:24:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> KUSC got a new snapshot earlier this week. Everything builds fine, except some segmentation faults after the latest Factory update. Fortunately only the kdebindings are affected.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">16:24:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> i see einar77 is looking to help fix some bindings things
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">16:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> That would be good, however for 11.3 all of them build except the akonadi/nepomuk bindings. This due to not being up to date with the latest api chagnes
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">16:25:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> *changes

<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">16:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> Well  I noticed that KTrafficAnalyzer had been stripped of it's patches and to ensure that I wasn't mistaken I installed the version from KDE:Extra and it crashed so I resorted to filing a bug. I'm only trying to ensure that a stableKTrafficAnalyzer is in KDE:Extra not trying to put anyone down although I was prety angry when I emailed last night and apologize for anything I said out of hand. And I haven't quoted any names in public
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">16:51:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> out of respect.

<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">16:52:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">davepl:</span> Well, you might have skipped the name but you fingerpointed that this was done by the first maintainer that rejected your initial request.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">16:52:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> Rules sometimes cause problems when they are followed blindly
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">16:53:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">davepl:</span> also please be aware that we're all from different backgrounds and our english is frequently slightly different

<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">16:53:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">davepl:</span> As bitshuffler already indicated we have plenty of examples where we go around the rules because we took the decision jointly.
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">16:53:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> Only visible to other maintainers and it was unfortunate that you missed sr no2

<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">16:54:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">davepl:</span> You assumed that I was the one who ruined the package as that I was the one rejecting it. Did you bother to look at the Package in KDE:Extra to see what happened there ?
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">16:54:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> davepl, tittiatcoke: i don't think we'll make it better by establishing the rights and wrongs of this ktrafficanalyzer package case
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">16:55:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;remur_030&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> it's propably a good example for bad communication...
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">16:56:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> what we need to do is forget this silly misunderstanding and move on but can I please submit the working KTrafficAnalyzer again.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">16:56:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> I agree. However this might be the first package that got fired upon with the new rules, but it won't be the last. So it has to be clear to the community what the initial rules are for KDE:Extra and how a request can be made to go around the rules. I believe that the link that llunak pointed at is correctly indicating the procedure
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">16:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> it seems that both dave and titti feel upset by the interaction so can we call it quits on this one?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">16:57:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> I'm happy
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">16:57:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> so the problem is that the fix is only in the svn version?
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">16:57:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;remur_030&gt;</span> do we have some kind of mediator in the project?
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">16:57:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> and it can't be backported to the release?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">16:58:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> I've incorporated the entire fix in one patch for the released version and you can leave the follow up with the author to me.
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">16:59:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> just read lubos link (http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_Extra_repository)
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">16:59:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> it seems clear

<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">16:59:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> Yup. That is what I thought too :-)
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">16:59:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> not an imperative :)
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">17:00:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> is the patched released version that dave just describe acceptable under those rules? (it sounds like it to me but i haven't seen it)
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">17:00:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> you can patch anything to anything with a big enough patch
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">17:01:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;davepl&gt;</span> I've had unstable packages from the community repo in the past so I can understand why this all happend.
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">17:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> :-) As indicated before we have plenty of examples where we discarded the rules and accepted the package in KDE:Extra. I personally have nothing against this package (even with svn version).
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">17:01:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">davepl:</span> yeah we are trying to tighten up the rules so there are clear levels of quality in the different projects
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">17:02:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> ok so to you it's just about the way this was communicated?
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">17:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wstephenson:</span> Yup.

<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">17:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wstephenson&gt;</span> ok, so davepl apologised.
