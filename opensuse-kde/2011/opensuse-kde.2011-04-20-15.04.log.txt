15:31:13 <wstephenson> other status: i've been teaching myself QML so i have a clue about maintaining/supporting plasmoids that use it

15:33:24 * tittiatcoke is reporting for the meeting. Apologies for being late
15:34:46 <tittiatcoke> wstephenson: You there ?
15:35:15 <wstephenson> yes
15:35:32 <tittiatcoke> Ok. It is very silent for a meeting :-)
15:35:33 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: any status from you?
15:35:47 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: got baby on knee. mrdocs chairing
15:36:22 <tittiatcoke> Ok. Nothing special. Have been working on PNM for NM 0.9
15:36:25 <mrdocs> tittiatcoke: waiting for you to arrive ^^   $topic
15:36:53 <mrdocs> next ?
15:37:10 <wstephenson> mrdocs: regular agenda items
15:37:14 <wstephenson> krop's sle11 topic
15:37:16 <mrdocs> #topic Remove SLE11, 11.2 and 11.3 from KDE:Unstable:Playground (krop)
15:37:54 <wstephenson> no objection re: SLE
15:37:56 <krop> topic says all, the kup builds are currently disabled for SLE11, 11.2, 11.3 and the KR45 repos
15:37:57 <wstephenson> 11.2 and 11.3 too?
15:38:10 <krop> mostly due to kdelibs being too old
15:38:20 <wstephenson> ah vanilla 11.2 and 11.3
15:38:25 <wstephenson> fine by me
15:38:28 <krop> yes
15:38:31 <mrdocs> same
15:38:32 <wstephenson> any objections?
15:38:36 <tittiatcoke> I disabled those build already since the last team meeting :-)
15:38:57 <alin> +1
15:39:02 <mrdocs> aha son consider done ?
15:39:03 <wstephenson> ok, removing the repos now
15:39:26 <mrdocs> #topic Status Plasmoid-networkmanagement (PNM) with regards to NetworkManager 0.9 (which will be knocking on Factory's door soon). (tittiatcoke)
15:40:05 <tittiatcoke> This is purely to update everybody on the status of PNM regarding compatibility of NM 0.9
15:41:03 <cartman> Does it work? :)
15:41:04 <tittiatcoke> Up to this morning it was quite hopeless, but after talking to jkrimes of Fedora, things got a lot better :-)  It seems that there is a hidden compatibility mode that let us run PNM with only some small changes
15:41:21 <mrdocs> sweet
15:41:40 <tittiatcoke> Now it works fine. I still have to test a couple of things, but it seems that it functions normally. So moving NM 0.9 to Factory wouldn't be an issue.
15:41:48 <mrdocs> lovely
15:41:54 <tittiatcoke> wstephenson: Any update from your side regarding the plans to fully support NM 0.9 ?
15:42:33 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: nope
15:43:01 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: how is the compat mode enabled?
15:44:07 <tittiatcoke> There is a patch for NM 0.9, which the Gnome team already has enabled. From that point we have a patch for kdebase4-workspace and a patch for PNM. It seems just to talk to a specific DBus Compat function
15:44:43 <tittiatcoke> wstephenson: You can check both patches out in home:rwooninck:special
15:44:49 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: ok
15:45:23 <tittiatcoke> I understood from vuntz that NM 0.9 will first go to GNOME:Factory and from there it will be submitted to Factory. This might still take 1 or 2 weeks
15:45:42 <wstephenson> godo
15:45:44 <wstephenson> good
15:46:12 <mrdocs> tittiatcoke: anything else to add ?
15:46:22 <tittiatcoke> Nope.
15:46:40 <mrdocs> ok
15:46:41 <mrdocs> next
15:46:55 <mrdocs> #topic Time of the meeting. (tittiatcoke)
15:47:53 <tittiatcoke> I just raised this one as that with the Summertime, the meeting is now at 5pm CET. Which might not be the real best time for the meeting. Initially it was set for 4pm. Question is if we should leave it at this time or push it back one hour to 4pm or maybe push it to 6pm ?
15:48:11 <wstephenson> tittiatcoke: a no brainer
15:48:22 <tittiatcoke> :-) Tell me :-)
15:48:24 <wstephenson> 4pm suits me
15:48:30 <wstephenson> just do the DST adjustment
15:48:31 <mrdocs> same mostly
15:48:42 <wstephenson> 6pm is really bad for me with the little one
15:48:46 <tittiatcoke> Sounds good for me.
15:48:48 <mrdocs> same
15:49:00 <tittiatcoke> Can imagine. 5pm is normally the time that I leave the office :-)
15:49:02 <mrdocs> any one else objecting ?
15:50:01 <mrdocs> #info next meeting will be pushed back to 16:00 CET owing to DST
