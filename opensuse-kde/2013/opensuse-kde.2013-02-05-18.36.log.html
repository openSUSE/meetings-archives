<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:38:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. First topic then.
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:38:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Action Items</span>
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:39:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Action:</span> tittiatcoke keep the discussion apper/kupdateapplet on the actionlist until we know what happens with the PackageKit zypp backend.
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> This one can be closed as that the Zypp backend was migrated to the new PK 0.8 and we have also a new apper in KDF/12.3/Factory
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:39:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> cool
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:40:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> out of curiosity. migrated by who?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:40:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rabauke:</span> coolo :-)
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> so he is the new zypp maintainer :p
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:41:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I guess he had enough of zypp and PK after this one :)
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:41:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> well, RH will break api again next week.. that's a given
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:42:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Target for the Zypp team is still to make a real rewrite of the zypp-backend to take advantage of the pk 0.8 possibilities and to enable that certain actions can be executed in parallel
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> we can only complain about that if at least everything zypper related has been done. which was not the case in the past.
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:42:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> complain about RH breaking the api.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:43:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:43:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> maybe the zypp team could find the resources if RH didn't make them start from scratch every other week... but we digress
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:44:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Maybe. But for now we are safe :-)
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:44:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> as if they ever started. :)
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. Guys. Next action point. :-)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:45:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Action:</span>  wstephenson will work on ksuseinstall (bug#671578)
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:45:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. Will check with Will tomorrow on this one.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:46:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Action tittiatcoke ask llunak if he is willing/interested to support ksuseinstall. If not then ksuseinstall will be dropped
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:49:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> On this I can report that I had contact with llunak and he was a little surprise that we are willing to drop ksuseinstall as that it was a much wanted topic back then. However he also indicated that he doesn't really have the time to help out on this.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> well, of course ksuseinstall would be very wanted. If it was maintained and worked as expected.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:51:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Unfortunately we don't have the feedback from will on the indicated bug
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:51:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> then leave it on the action list for next time
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:51:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> it'd be excellent if the packman repo was default ;-) ... but without that, I'm not sure of the value, even if bugs are fixed
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> also, cuz of bugs and spam in the mime db apparently, which we are defenseless against
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:52:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rabauke:</span> Ok.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:52:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> That is also correct
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:54:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Let's leave it for the next meeting, then we can discuss with Will if he can provide some more support on this. It is too late to make this kind of change for 12.3 anyway.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:55:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Next action item.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Action:</span>  tittiatcoke check the updater/packagekit situation in Gnome and validate open bugreports for Apper
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:55:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> This one can be closed due to the update to PK 0.8 and Apper 0.8. Existing bug reports for Apper were validated against the new version and closed.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:56:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Also 12.3 will bring a solution in libsolv where the zypp backend would prefer to install an update despite that this would cause a downgrade of other applications (e.g. KDE)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:57:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Next action:  alin to push simon to KDE:Extra

<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:04:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Yeah :-)  Last Friday evening I pushed KDE 4.10.0 (official) tarballs into KDF, got it build for Factory and pushed it on Monday to Factory. It has been accepted and forwarded to 12.3. So hopefully we will get the RC1 with KDE 4.10.0. Based on the status in KDF, I created KR410 and had it build for 12.2. So once the announce is made, we can announce the KR410 repo.

<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> we still have the indexer off by default right?

<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rabauke&gt;</span> having this bug would be one argument in the discussion whether to leave it off. and it helps to understand users complaining if one knows that there is a bug which is not going to be fixed upstream.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shumski&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rabauke:</span> ok, i don't have it with master, and with most files at index level #2. probably the second then

<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:56:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> before installing firefox, you mean?
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:56:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> yup
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:57:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> I think I made a false report. I always thought it was thunderbird which triggered the installation of tracker with my update for 12.2.

<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:57:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> the tracker-miner-firefox will be suggested if you want to install both tracker and firefox. Only firefox should not trigger this supplement

<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">20:00:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> I think apper needs widespread testing just in case
