17:39:29 <mrdocs> #meetingtopic Welcome to the openSUSE KDE community IRC meeting! Please wait with other discussion until the meeting is over. This meeting is logged
17:42:08 <alin> mrdocs: thought was cancelled
17:48:07 <Solaris444> Hi all.
17:49:41 <Solaris444> Meeting is starting?
17:51:05 <Solaris444> mrdocs?
17:51:05 <mrdocs> Solaris444: waiting for people to show
17:51:12 <Solaris444> ahhhh. ok sure.
17:51:22 <mrdocs> alin: no Raymond asked me to sub for him
17:51:32 <mrdocs> But, I think we should just re-schedule
17:51:42 <NicoK> imho, the meeting should be announced at the ml...
17:51:47 <Solaris444> Why is that? Too many people busy?
17:51:51 <mrdocs> NicoK: it was
17:52:09 <mrdocs> bad to schedule meetings on a holiday
17:52:18 <mrdocs> the Yanks are nuts about Halloween :)
17:52:19 <alin> mrdocs: where holiday?
17:52:26 <alin> mrdocs: here they are just drunk
17:52:27 <NicoK> sounded more like just a request for a new host :)
17:52:49 <alin> mrdocs: which remembers me I need to make it to the pub before the students finish their dorm beers
17:52:59 * mrdocs grins
17:53:09 <Solaris444> Drunk? I like the sound of that.
17:53:16 <Solaris444> I code better on alcohol.
17:55:48 <alin> mrdocs: let us start serious things
17:56:00 <alin> what was on agenda?
17:56:13 <Solaris444> Previous action items?
17:58:05 <NicoK> I'm still working on fixing links in KR49 to KDF (and pushing changes to KDF) but made progress last week (unfortunately I don't have much time lately)
18:00:46 <mrdocs> alin: Does the openSUSE KDE Team want to have Apper as updater and application/x-rpm MIME type handler for 12.3?
18:00:47 <Solaris444> I haven't had any response on my bnc #659153
18:01:20 <Solaris444> mrdocs, It was ridiculous to move to it in the first place in my opinion.
18:01:28 * mrdocs nods
18:01:38 <mrdocs> I thnk we should cancel and re-schedule
18:01:43 <Solaris444> OK, lets.
18:02:54 <mrdocs> #info meeting canceled and will reschedule on the ML
