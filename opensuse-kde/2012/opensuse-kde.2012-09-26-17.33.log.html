<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">17:36:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. Then lets start with the first topic.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">17:36:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Team organization</span>
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">17:37:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77_work:</span> ping
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">17:37:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cartman:</span> ping
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">17:37:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alin:</span> einar77 indicated that he would be a little later
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">17:37:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> italians are always late...
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">17:37:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> joking...
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">17:38:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I raised the topic of Team organization to discuss how we as an community team want to continue. I guess that everybody read on the mailinglist that Will can no longer full time support the KDE team as that the Boosters also has to take other tasks. Based on his indication I had the feeling that we seem to be a little lost (so to speak)
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">17:39:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Any comments on this /
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">17:39:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">17:40:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> first we shall know on whom we can really to break things
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">17:40:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> so packaging mainly needs to be done by community members?
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">17:40:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> I do not see rabauke
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">17:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> That's what I understood
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">17:41:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> krop is missing too
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">17:41:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> what does this exactly mean (will not being available), e.g. which tasks have to be done by someone else now?
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">17:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Correct. I had a discussion with Dimstar on the situation in the Gnome team and it is the same situation there. Gnome is community driven at the moment
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">17:41:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alin:</span> rabauke couldn't make it. He seems to have only time during the weekend.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">17:43:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> we should identify and make a list of the tasks that we need to do now - also it seems that there are some scripts out there to ease packaging in case a new version comes out - it wuold be nice to have them available somewhere
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">17:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> to avoid double work
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">17:43:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> A lot is already done by community members. Look at the KR49 repo. A perfect example of community work. Also KUSC is community driven.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">17:44:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> One of the tasks that needs to be handled is the coordination of the team efforts, leading/organization the team meetings and sometimes to make a final decision on something
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">17:44:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> I think we shall nominate one person for each repo
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">17:44:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> i see you in the same place as Dimstar - our benevolent overlord :)
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">17:44:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> teh things i can think of is packaging, bug assignees and support (in a broad sense) and documentation
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">17:45:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> Lol :-) but I am not sure if the whole team sees it also that way
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">17:46:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> it's a meritocracy.. whoever will package stuff and fix bugs in KDF automatically becomes an/the overlord
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">17:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">17:47:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> true. But still there are some things that goes beyond just packaging and fixing stuff
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">17:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> I guess the persons who can tell us are the ones who did the job before
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">17:48:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Which is Bille in this case :-)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">17:49:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I don't think we have to sort it out tonight, but I wanted to catch your thoughts on this subject and to see if the team is ready to become completely community-driven :-)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">17:49:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> he will be able to read this later - might be an idea to create a list of things so far done by the boosters team - for KDE of course
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">17:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> I think we do not have a big choice in that - the alternative is to fail I guess
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">17:50:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Yes. I will ask him to put some things in an email so that we can see what needs to be done and how to organize this.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">17:50:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">skunze1:</span> :-)
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">17:51:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> maybe don't just put it into an email but also the wiki - or at least we need to sum it up in the wiki at some point...
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">17:51:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> the wiki is also a point
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">17:52:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Another item in this category is the indication that alin did. We had the same thing in the past, but the old masters disappeared slowly. I think it would be good to nominate a responsible person for each of the repositories we have. (In my opinion this would be KRxy, KDS, KDF, KUSC).
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">17:52:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Ok. I will create a wiki page for this, where we can list the tasks we see and put also our comments there.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">17:52:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> it should be clear then what this person is supposed to do
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">17:53:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> here's an old list of the general maintainers' responsibilities: http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_Maintainers_Cheat_Sheet
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">17:54:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> That looks like a good starting point
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">17:54:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> indeed
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">17:54:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> dont forget if Bille is busy I can access private bugs now
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">17:55:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> noted :-)
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">17:55:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> L3 Bugs - we need to cut that out or find a solution - I think no community member has access to those
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">17:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> i'm on leave for the next 2 weeks btw
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">17:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">skunze1:</span> the short term solution is I negitate :)
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">17:55:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> negotiate
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">17:55:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> btw, congrats :-)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">17:55:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">skunze1:</span> yep, and we're even trying to kick those out of the openSUSE Team's task list. but it needs kde maintenance skills in another team
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">17:55:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> thanks
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">17:56:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> and we should do this without scoring the own goal of getting SLE to drop all kde packages :)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">17:56:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> true :)
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">17:56:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> you mean no more KDE in SLE ?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">17:56:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;maxlin&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">17:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> yes
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">17:56:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> late late late!
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">17:57:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> Is the meeting still ongoing?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">17:57:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> couldn't make any faster than this
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">17:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77:</span> we're still at the first topic ;)
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">17:57:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77:</span> Yup. We are at the same topic :-) Team organization
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">17:57:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> then the question is can we maintain SLE build then ?
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">17:57:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mrdocs&gt;</span> even if unoffical builds
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">17:58:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> *we* can certainly build vs sle releases
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">17:58:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> I mean if Gnome is in the same situation - SLE will not drop Gnome and KDE
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">17:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mrdocs:</span> anyway that is only one bad possible outcome i want to avoid
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">17:58:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> it hasn't happened
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">17:58:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> before we decide on reps for kde repos maybe we shall first decide on repos
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">17:59:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> and it would be a dishonest outcome given that there is customer demand for kde
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">17:59:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> anyway, not really on-topic
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">17:59:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> true
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">17:59:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> Any comments/hints from your side on how we should organize ourselves as a team
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:00:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> not too many people on each responsibility, so people don't assume someone else will do a task
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:00:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alin:</span> I would like to have first an alignment if we need such persons per repo. Then later when we have the repo's we can assign a person if required
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:00:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> Ok.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:01:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I'd say, have at least 2 persons per repo for cases of unavailability
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:01:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> in maintenance i'm out - I'm neither a developer nor packager (yet) and it will take a while to reach an level to take on task like this
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:02:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> +1
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:03:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> That would be good. I see the tasks of such person(s) to review/accept the SR's, be the main contact for that repo and in the case of KRxy when to update to a newer version.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:04:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> and of course to coordinate the work in that repo.
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:05:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> not to mention that different repos have different levels of maintenance in my view
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77:</span> can you elaborate a little more on that ?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:05:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> if main development is happening only in KDF though - then the other repo's "gurus" don't have much to do... so basically we need someone for KDF
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:05:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> a KDF needs in my view more work than a KRxy
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> not to say that the latter is no work
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:06:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> quite the opposite
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> I agree, but KRxy would have monthly updates, etc. And I think that KRxy is much more exposed to the outside world than KDF
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:06:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> hm, I gueess you're right
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:07:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> but KRxy should only link to KDF versions, so imho this means, after/immediately before a new release: get it building in KDF, then link it to KRxy
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:07:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> the only exception to that was the period of the 12.2 freeze for KDF recently
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:08:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> can we define x?
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:08:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Correct, but the question would be if we have 4.9.3 in KR49 and KDF is jumping from 4.9.3 to 4.10 beta, would we no longer update KR49 to 4.9.4 when that comes ?
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:08:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> let us say.. we maintain x=current and x-1
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> the rest people are on their own?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> I would keeep the Rxy repos until upstream EOLs
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">18:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> anyway, we need to keep (double) work down as much as possible; concentrating on one repo alone is already much to do
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alin:</span> So you mean we would support KR49 and KR48 ?
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:09:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> for KDS the question wouldbe bugfixes for the 2 year maintenanceperiod
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:09:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> As upstream, I would say there's little gain unless it's KDS
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:09:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> KDF only ever got RC's - and after an RC, normally no new minor release of the previous version comes out - 4.8.5 is the only exception I know of
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">18:09:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> KDS is the one that somehow is related with sled?

<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">18:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> as far as I understood KDS was created in the past where we didn't had the current maintenance support
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">18:11:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> KDS should build updates that then could be incorporated in the latest openSUSE official release.
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">18:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> then the discussion is for each repo against what base we build?

<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> KDS should only build against the release for which it was shipped

<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. Now let's have the big discussion :-)
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:14:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Let's start with the number one on the list. KDE:Distro:Stable.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> I propose to ax it
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:15:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> axe it
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:15:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I personally don't have any plans with it; nor do I see its use now that we have KRxy
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Currently that one contains the KDE release shipped with 12.2 and was intended to provide KDE minor updates as that there was no maintenance workflow yet.
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> if there are different ways to prepare patches, it has no use
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:15:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> (different _better_ ways)
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> ship updates from the according KRxy
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> probably the best
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:16:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> KRxy is still links from KDF no?
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:16:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> i'd dispute that purpose for KDS
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> only the when x=c
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:16:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alin&gt;</span> current
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> Ok.Can you help out on it's purpose ?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:17:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> as that use was removed by KRxy and osc maintenance
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:17:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> fixed links, i.e. it does not always point to the latest version in KDF
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> Ok, but in the past when we didn't had KRxy and osc maintenance, it was had that purpose ?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:17:46 </span><span class="nka">* tittiatcoke</span> <span class="ac">removes was</span>
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> say 12.2 has amarok 2.5 ... krxy has amarok 2.6.. how do prepare a patch for amarok in KRxy?
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> the purpose it still has is to test updates to the distro release KDE
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> there's the test-update repo though
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> the difference to KRxy is that you can leave it publish-enabled without affecting many users
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:19:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> isn't that, what the test-update repo is there for?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> then each revision has got to go through the maintenance team
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:19:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> ah, not good
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:20:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> it also serves to define the set of packages that we maintain for the distro release
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:20:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> Do we have examples from the past where we used KDS ?
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:20:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> so if I understand taht correctly KDS contains the shipped state + Updates fro KDE since shipment but no new Versionsupdates
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:21:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> otherwise how do you tell which packages to update and test? querying with osc maintainer, looking at the patterns, etc
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">skunze1:</span> not quite, we have done some .z updates in the patst
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> every maintenance update to KDE went through there
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> only 1 or 2 iirc
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:21:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> ie testing and adding patches
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:22:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> do we have the manpower to maintain that?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:22:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> IMHO the question is, do we want to ship updates to KDE SC regulrarly then we could use KRxy instead of KDS
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:22:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> that should be the question...
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:22:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> But that would mean that we should setup multiple KDS repo's. How else can we support the KDE version of 12.1 with the current KDS ?
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:22:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ctrippe:</span> that's a question and an answer
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> in practise we only tried hard to support the previous release
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> anything else was supported via osc branches
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:23:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> since we never had the manpower to offer perfect support for all  maintained releases
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:24:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. So the question would be more if we want to ship updates to KDE SC regurlary to our users.
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:24:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> as in point releases?
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:24:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Correct.
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:25:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> if we, and the opensuse project (via its maintenance team) accept to ship all .z point releases as maintenance updates, you could use KRxy for that
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:25:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> Although there may be regression, I would encourage that
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">18:25:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> regressions
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">18:25:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> +1
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">18:25:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> <span class="hi">einar77:</span> +1
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">18:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> as I said, I happen to see quite often people in the forums that have issues with version X while X.1 has it fixed
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">18:25:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> the drawback is you risk pissing off regular KRxy users while you are testing yet another unproven patch from the kdepim or nepomuk teams
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">18:25:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> I'd prefer not to have nepomuk and akonadi blow up in my face every month
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">18:25:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> or plasma
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">18:25:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> this is probably the most tested repo as (and I think, I'm not only talking about myself) we developers don't use KDS...
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">18:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> and what about non-SC stuff?
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">18:26:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> toe be honest, the only big issue with 4.9.0 -&gt; 4.9.1 was the kwin regression
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">18:26:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> does that also mean pushing feature releases of digikam and amarok etc. as official updates?
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">18:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> and we resolved that in the packages quite quickly...
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">18:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> anyway, thats all i have to add KDS, and i've said it already on the list
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">18:27:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> I guess we would have KUA for that one.
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">18:27:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;skunze1&gt;</span> if we ship x.y+.z updates regularily through online updates what do we do with the users that do not want to upgrade to a newer KDE in a release - in that case we would not fix bugs - or as a alternative - we could offer a block for KDE Updates in apper ?
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">18:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> before shipping KRxy as an update, we should probably let 2 weeks pass...
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">18:27:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> i wouldn't conflate non sc app version update policy with whether to use KDS or osc branches or KRxy for maintenance update development
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">18:27:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> +1
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">18:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> different discussion...
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">18:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> agreed, non SC stuff is another matter entirely
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">18:27:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctrippe&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> +1
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">18:28:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> (especially since some non SC stuff is... exotic in the way they do things)
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">18:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> how would you prefer to test inter-point release patches for critical bugs that show up after you've published? osc branch?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">18:29:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> they'd be tested in kdf I guess?
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">18:29:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> first testing in KDF (since this is the main development project), then (if successful), update link in KRxy
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">18:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> before KDF probably a osc branch
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">18:29:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> that's what I did in the past
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">18:30:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Bille&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> what if kdf is 4.10 and the last opensuse release had 4.9?
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">18:30:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> if it affects only one package
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">18:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Bille:</span> when 4.10 lands KDF, there shouldn't be any extra point releases of 4.9
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">18:31:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> anyway, if KDF and KR49 are decoupled, packages are copied to KR49 and thus we can test 49 specific patches there
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">18:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> the preiod where this is necessary (and we really have 2 dev branches) should be rather short
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">18:31:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> *period
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">18:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. If I conclude on what has been said, then the KDE team would like very much to provide point releases throught the standard update process of an openSUSE release.And the preferred way of providing these updates is to utilize the KRxy reo for this.
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">18:32:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> agreed

<a name="l-404"></a><span class="tm">19:15:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> example in case is udisks2

<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">19:17:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> 2. how do we keep in touch with upstream to know what's needed?
<a name="l-417"></a><span class="tm">19:17:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;einar77&gt;</span> I can probably give a hand with point 2

The next big chunck is going to be the removal of ConsoleKit, where we would require additional patches to kdebase4-workspace so that it gets systemd awareness. Those patches are not even upstream

<a name="l-511"></a><span class="tm">19:33:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> there are still some packages that differ from KDF :(
<a name="l-512"></a><span class="tm">19:34:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> the main reason is because development diverged between the two
<a name="l-513"></a><span class="tm">19:34:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> and at least two changelog entries exist now and I don't really know how to proceed with them
<a name="l-514"></a><span class="tm">19:34:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> dunno if this qualifies.. but we seem to have shipped krita crashing on startup with 12.2.. and the same happens with calligra 2.4.3... any plans of getting calligra 2.5.x to KDF?
<a name="l-515"></a><span class="tm">19:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Which packages ?
<a name="l-516"></a><span class="tm">19:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> I already tried that
<a name="l-517"></a><span class="tm">19:35:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> and had problems with the changelogs...
<a name="l-518"></a><span class="tm">19:35:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> So KR49 has Calligra 2.5.x ?

<a name="l-520"></a><span class="tm">19:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Ok. Let me check that tomorrow and then get calligra 2.5.x in KDF asap

<a name="l-525"></a><span class="tm">19:37:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tittiatcoke:</span> a lot actually

<a name="l-530"></a><span class="tm">19:38:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ok:</span> the main question there (which I also posted to the opensuse-kde ml) is whether and how to keep the attributions or KR49 packagers
<a name="l-531"></a><span class="tm">19:38:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cb400f&gt;</span> hmm.. so 2.5 will prolly be affected too without the change :-/

<a name="l-534"></a><span class="tm">19:38:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I polished that one in another try at this regard

<a name="l-536"></a><span class="tm">19:40:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> That one seems to be fine.
<a name="l-537"></a><span class="tm">19:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> which?
<a name="l-538"></a><span class="tm">19:41:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> the latest Calligra submit
<a name="l-539"></a><span class="tm">19:41:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I hope so, too :)
<a name="l-540"></a><span class="tm">19:41:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> but I couldn't keep the timestamps of the KR49 changes - anyway, they probably don't matter that much
<a name="l-541"></a><span class="tm">19:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> at least the attributions are still there
<a name="l-542"></a><span class="tm">19:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Well, I will accept that one now :-)
<a name="l-543"></a><span class="tm">19:42:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I don't know if there are any further changes in KR49 but already the changes in KDF make re-linking KR49 not easy
<a name="l-544"></a><span class="tm">19:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Can imagine.
<a name="l-545"></a><span class="tm">19:43:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> anyway, as mentioned before, iirc Dirk had some scripts easing KDE updates - I'd like to have those scripts documented/available somewhere
<a name="l-546"></a><span class="tm">19:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> if possible
<a name="l-547"></a><span class="tm">19:44:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> (for next updates)
<a name="l-548"></a><span class="tm">19:44:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> atm though there is a lot of work to be done to get KR49 clean and push changes to KDF before development continues even more in KDF
<a name="l-549"></a><span class="tm">19:44:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> What type of scripts ? I have a script with which I am pushing the updates of KUSC (and creating the tarballs automatically from the git sources). But I guess I can adjust it to download the tarballs from a certain location
<a name="l-550"></a><span class="tm">19:45:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok. Any further updates ?
<a name="l-551"></a><span class="tm">19:46:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I always thought of "download release/pre-release tarballs" -&gt; "adapt package spec" -&gt; "osc ar"-&gt; "osc ci..."
<a name="l-552"></a><span class="tm">19:46:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> and from what I read, I suspect the final tarballs are available somewhere before the release for us packagers...
<a name="l-553"></a><span class="tm">19:46:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> I will change my script a little and then send it to you
<a name="l-554"></a><span class="tm">19:46:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> I'm not on the appropriate ml though
<a name="l-555"></a><span class="tm">19:46:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Correct.
<a name="l-556"></a><span class="tm">19:47:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> ok, could we publish that for the other maintainers?
<a name="l-557"></a><span class="tm">19:47:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Sure
<a name="l-558"></a><span class="tm">19:47:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;maxlin&gt;</span> btw I have a talk of our KDE working model on osc'12(the topic is maintenance model though)
<a name="l-559"></a><span class="tm">19:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;NicoK&gt;</span> that would be great
<a name="l-560"></a><span class="tm">19:47:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> Ok

<a name="l-568"></a><span class="tm">19:49:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;maxlin&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cb400f:</span> I will

<a name="l-570"></a><span class="tm">19:50:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tittiatcoke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">NicoK:</span> Correct. For now we should put priority on that and try to prevent package maintainance in KDF until KR49 is in shape.
